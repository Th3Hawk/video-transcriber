GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.
PROJECT BEFORE THE COMMISSION
THIS EVENING IS THE CENTERVILLE
PLAZA APARTMENTS LOCATED ON THE
VACANT PORTION OF THE BLOCK
BOUNDED BY FREMONT BLCHED,
PARISH AVENUE, JASON WAY AND
PERALTA BOULEVARD.
THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS THE
PHASED DEVELOPMENT OF A MIXED
USE PROJECT CONSISTING OF
AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING AND
GROUND THROOR SPACE.
THE PROJECT SITE IS LOCATED ON A
APPROXIMATELY FOIRP 43 ACRE
SITE, DESIGNATED TONY CENTER IN
THE GENERAL PLAN.
THE SITE IS DESIGNED OVERLAY DUE
TO THE SITE'S PROXIMITY TO THE
SNERL ACE AND AMTRAK STATION.
THE SITE WAS PREVENT THE SILICON
SAGE CENTERVILLE PROJECT BEFORE
THE DEVELOPER WENT BANKRUPT.
93 APARTMENTS, 72 TOWN HOMES AND
APPROXIMATELY 25,000 SQUARE FEET
OF COMMERCIAL SPACE.
ALL BUILDINGS ON THE SITE WERE
DEMOLISHED BY THE PROJECT
DEVELOPER BEFORE THE SILICON
SAGE PROJECT WAS HALTED.
THE SITE HAS REMAINED VACANT
SINCE 2020.
THE PROJECT WOULD BE DWOAPPED IN
TWO PHASES.
PHASE 1 WOULD CONSIST OF
BUILDING 1 AT THE SOUTHERN END
OF THE PROJECT SITE AND WOULD
DEVELOP 140 FOOTBALL APARTMENTS
AND APPROXIMATELY 1600 SQUARE
FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE.
PHASE 2 WOULD CONSIST OF
BUILDINGS 2, AND 3, BUILDING 2
WOULD HAVE 133 AFFORDABLE
APARTMENTS AND APPROXIMATELY
3500 SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL
SPACE.
BUILDING 3 WOULD CONTAIN 17
AFFORDABLE APARTMENTS.
THE BUILDINGS ALONG FREMONT
BOULEVARD WOULD BE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF A STATE DENSITY
BONUS RULE THAT PERMITS
INCREASES IN HEIGHT FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.
BUILDINGS 1 AND 2 WOULD BE FIVE
STORIES IN HEIGHT.
BUILDING 3 LOCATED ON PERALTA
BOULEVARD WOULD BE THREE STORIES
IN HEIGHT.
THE BUILDINGS WOULD BE PLACED ON
THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY WITH
MINIMAL SET BACKS AS IS
TYPICALLY FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE
CORE OF THE TOWN CENTERS.
ACCESS TO THE SITE WOULD BE
INITIALLY ARE VIA TWO DRIVEWAYS,
ONE ONTO FREMONT BOULEVARD AND
ONE ON TO PARISH AVENUE.
UPON THE COMPLETION OF PHASE 2 A
THIRD DRIVEWAY WOULD BE
COMPLETED ON PERALTA BOULEVARD.
THE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE
DIRECT ACCESS ON TO JASON WAY.
THE PARKING WOULD BE LOCATED
BEHIND THE BUILDINGS AT THE REAR
OF THE SITE.
THE THERE WOULD BE A LANDSCAPE
BUFFER BETWEEN THE PARKING LOT
AND JASON WAY.
DUE TO THE PROJECT'S LOCATION
WITHIN THE TRANSIT ORIENTED
DEVELOPMENT AREA THE PROJECT IS
NOTE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY
VEHICLE PARKING.
THE APPLICANT HAS VOLUNTARILY
PROPOSED A TOTAL OF 253 ONSITE
PARKING SPACES INCLUDING 123 EV
PARKING SPACES.
BICYCLE PARKING WOULD CONSIST OF
149 LONG TERM SPACES WITHIN
SECURED ROOMS AND 41 SHORT TERM
BIKE PARKING SPACES.
BICYCLE PARKING WOULD BE
REQUIRED TO CONFORM TO THE
APPLICABLE STANDARDS.
THE PROJECT WOULD INCLUDE A
NUMBER OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS,
INCLUDING A MID BLOCK CROSSWALK
OWN FREMONT BOULEVARD, IMPROVED
SIDEWALKS, AN UNDERGROUNDING OF
SOME UTILITIES, AND THE
DEDICATION OF A PORTION OF JASON
WAY TO COMPLETE A CONNECTION TO
IN MARCH 2024, THE CITY COUNCIL
AWARDED 12.85 MILLION DOLLARS TO
THE APPLICANT TO ACQUIRE LAND
FOR THIS PROJECT.
CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY
COUNCIL'S APPROVAL THE PROPOSED
PROJECT WOULD IMPLEMENT CREATION
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS MADE
POSSIBLE WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS.
THE RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE
PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD CONSIST
ENTIRELY OF INCOME RESTRICTED
RENTAL UNITS, EXCEPT FOR TWO
MANAGER UNITS.
THE PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE 288
UNITS RESTRICTED TO VERY LOW AND
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.
PURSUANT TO STATE DENSITY BONUS
LAW AND THE CITY'S DENSITY BONUS
ORDINANCE, THE PROJECT QUALIFIES
FOR AND IS ENTITLED TO A DENSITY
BONUS.
AS PART OF THE DENSITY BONUS THE
PROJECT IS ENTITLED TO
CONCESSIONS AND AN UNLIMITED
NUMBER OF WAIVERS FROM
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN ORDER
TO INCENTIVIZE THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE
PROJECT IS ENTITLED TO A HEIGHT
INCREASE WHICH BUILDINGS 1 AND 2
ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF.
THE APPLICANT HAS NOT REQUESTED
ANY CONCESSIONS AT THIS TIME.
BUT HAS REQUESTED TEN WAIVERS.
THE CITY IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE
AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF WAIVERS
OR DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS THAT
WOULD PRECLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT
FROM BUILDING AT THE REQUESTED
DENSITY.
THE REQUESTED WAIVERS ARE
RELATED TO COMMON OPEN SPACE,
THE LOCATION OF BUILDING
ENTRANCES, MASSING OF EERKT AND
THE CONFIGURATION OF THE
COMMERCIAL COMPONENT.
THE APPLICANT HAS REQUESTED THAT
NECESSARY FOR THE PROJECT AT THE
PROPOSED DENSITY AND IF NOT
GRANTED, WOULD PHYSICALLY
PRECLUDE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PROJECT.
THE CITY MAY NOT DENY A WAIVER
REQUEST EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC LIFE
SAFETY REASONS DESCRIBED IN THE
STAFF REPORT.
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE
PLANNING COMMISSION FIND THAT NO
FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS
REQUIRED PER CEQA.
FIND THAT THE PROJECT IS IN
CONFORMANCE WITH DENSITY BONUS
LAW.
AND THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
PLAN CONFORMS TO APPLICABLE
RULES.
AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION
APPROVE THE PROJECT AS SHOWN IN
EXHIBIT B SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS
OF APPROVAL CONTAINED IN EXHIBIT
C.
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE
APPLICANT TO DO THE
PRESENTATION, AND THE APPLICANT
HAS TEN MINUTES.
YES, THANK YOU.
Vice Chair Ramamurthi:   I
APOLOGIZE.
CAN WE TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK?
MY ALARM WENT OFF AND MY BLOOD
SUGAR IS DROPPING SO I'LL
QUICKLY EAT SOMETHING.
FIVE MINUTES, THANK YOU.
[ SHORT RECESS ]
THANKS EVERYONE FOR WAITING
PATIENTLY.
I APPRECIATE IT.
WE INVITE THE APPLICANT TO START
NOW.
PRESENTATION, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD EVENING
COMMISSIONERS, MY NAME IS MIKE
ALLEN, I REPRESENT U.S.A.
PROPERTIES WHO IS A DEVELOPER AT
THIS PROJECT.
FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO THANK
STAFF FOR THE INCREDIBLE HELP
AND COUNSEL THEY HAVE GIVEN US
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS NOW
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.
SO VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO
PRESENT THIS TO THE COMMISSION
TONIGHT.
BEFORE WE START OWN THE PROJECT
DETAILS, I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A
QUICK OVERVIEW OF U.S.A.
PROPERTIES.
U.S.A. PROPERTIES IS A
45-YEAR-OLD COMPANY PRIMARILY
FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
PRIMARILY IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE
ALSO HAVE A PRESENCE IN NEVADA
AND OREGON AND 12,000 UNITS OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE'RE
VERY PROUD OF THAT.
THE MAP TO THE RIGHT SHOWS OUR
BAY AREA PRESENCE.
YOU CAN SEE WE'RE VERY ACTIVE
TRYING TO SOLVE THE HOUSING
CRISIS.
EACH ONE OF THOSE REPRESENTS
DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
SO SOME OF THEM ARE IN DEUTLE, DUE
DILIGENCE, SOME ARE IN
CONSTRUCTION.
OUR COMPANY IS STRUCTURED VERY
UNIQUELY.
WE'RE ALL IN HOUSE, REQUISITION
AND DEVELOPMENT, BRINGING THESE
TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION,
PERMITS, ONCE THE PERMITS ARE
GRANTED WE PASS THEM OFFS TO OUR
IN HOUSE CONSTRUCTION TEAM WHO
BUILDS THE PROJECT AND ONCE THE
PROJECT IS BUILT IT GETS PASSED
TO OUR IN HOUSE PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT TEAM.
THIS IS KEY.
WHEN WE DESIGN THESE PROJECTS
WE'RE VERY INTERESTED WITH HOW A
DESIGN WORKS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO BE THERE.
WE DON'T SELL THEM.
WE'RE IN FOR THE LONG HAUL SO WE
TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION
WHEN SIGNING THESE PROJECTS.
JAMES TOOK A LOT OF MY THUNDER
SO I'M NOTE GOING TO REPEAT
THINGS.
I'LL TRY TO FOCUS ON THE
BENEFITS AND THINGS YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD ALREADY.
THE MAP ON THE LEFT, WE ALREADY
HEARD ABOUT THE UNITS, THE
PARKING, BIKE PARKING, THE MAP
ON THE LEFT, WE PUT A COUPLE OF
DIMENSIONS ON THERE WHICH I
THINK ARE KEY.
SO THE WHOLE IDEA WITH THIS
DESIGN IS TO KEEP THE MASSING ON
FREMONT BOULEVARD.
AND KEEP IT AWAY FROM EXISTING
NEIGHBORHOODS AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.
SO LITTLE TOUGH TO SEE BUT ON
THAT PHASE ONE WHICH IS THE
SOUTH BUILDING THERE WE HAVE A
77 FOOT SET BACK FROM OUR
PROPERTY LINE TO THE EDGE OF OUR
BUILDING.
AND AS IT GOES UP, YOU SEE THE
SET BACK GETS EVEN GREATER.
ON PERALTA WE HAVE AN 86 FOOT
SET BACK.
PHASE 2 HAS AN 89 FOOT SET BACK.
WE REALLY TRIED TO CREATE A
BUFFER ZONE.
WE PUT ANOTHER DIMENSION THERE
OUR BUILDING TO THE ACTUAL
HOUSE.
SO YOU SEE IT'S UPWARDS FROM 155
FEET, 1 SKI FEET SO THERE'S A
BIG DISTANCE WHICH I THINK IS
IMPORTANT.
ALL SURFACE PARKED LIKE JAMES
SAID.
THE RETAIL IS REPRESENTED IN
ORANGE.
SO THE LAST DEVELOPER HAD
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RETAIL.
WE ARE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
DEVELOPERS, TYPICALLY DON'T DO
RETAIL BUT SEE THE VALUE OF IT
IN THIS SITE SO 5100 SQUARE FEET
GIVE OR TAKE.
I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THE TWO
CORNER ORANGE SPOTS ARE PLUMBED
FOR QUICK SERVICE RESTAURANTS.
SO SMALL PIZZARIA, SMALL
SANDWICH SPOT, BENEFIT TO THE
COMMUNITY COULD BE BUILT THERE.
THIS IS A QUICK DIAGRAM OF THE
FIRST FLOOR OF PHASE 1.
JUST TO SHOW YOU, I DID WANT TO
POINT OUT THE BIKE, YOU CAN'T
REALLY SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE --
JAMES TOLD ME NOT TO DO THIS AND
I DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM, YOU CAN
SEE THE BIKE ROOM, INDOOR
SECURED BIKE ROOM RIGHT NEXT TO
THE RETAIL.
WE ALSO PROVIDE AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF SERVICES TO OUR
RESIDENTS SUCH AS JOB TRAINING,
FINANCIAL COACHING THINGS LIKE
THAT TO HELP EVERYBODY GET A
BETTER LIFE.
AND THIS, THIS EXHIBIT SHOWS THE
PRIOR SILICON SAGE DEVELOPMENT
ON THE RIGHT VERSUS OUR
DEVELOPMENT ON THE LEFT.
SO YOU CAN SEE THE TOWN HOMES ON
THE RIGHT WERE BUILT OUGHT THE
WAY UP TO JASON WAY.
THEY HAD FIVE DIFFERENT
DRIVEWAYS COMING OFF OF JASON
WAY AND ON OUR LIKE JAMES SAID
WE HAVE NO ENTRANCES OFF OF
JASON WAY, IT IS ALL OFF OF
PERALTA AND FREMONT BOULEVARD.
BEE TODAY HAVE A COMMUNITY
MEETING IN OCTOBER WHERE WE
MAILED OUT PROBABLY 400 PLERTS
AND WE HELD A COMMUNITY MEETING
IN THE CHURCH RIGHT ACROSS THE
STREET.
ABOUT 15 OR 20 PEOPLE SHOWED UP
AND IT WAS GREATLY TO GET THEIR
PERSPECTIVE ON THE TRAFFIC,
MASSING, TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE
TRIED TO MAKE THE MASSING ALL ON
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO POINT
OUT TO YOU WHEN WE HAD THAT
COMMUNITY MIEGHT WE HAD 312
UNITS.
SINCE THEN WE TOOK SOME OF THEIR
COMMENTS AND WE ACTUALLY
REDUCED, FOR THAT REASON AND FOR
OTHER REASONS TOO, FOR ONE OF
THE REASONS WE HEARD THE
NEIGHBORS COMMENTS AND REDUCED
IT DOWN TO 292 UNITS NOW.
THAT REDUCED OUR UNITS A LITTLE
BIT AND REDUCED OUR PARKING A
LITTLE BIT.
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE.
AT THIS TIME I'VE GOT THE REST
OF MY DESIGN TEAM HERE.
MARK KINER WILL SPEAK ON THE
ARCHITECTURE AND WE ALSO HAVE T.
J. EDWARDS, ANY TECHNICAL
CONCERNS COME UP WE'LL BE ABLE
TO ANSWER THEM SO MARK.
THANK YOU, COMMISSIONERS.
JUST REAL QUICK.
AGAIN, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
THE CONCEPT OF HOW THE BUILDINGS
WORK ON THE SITE.
OBVIOUSLY, THE RELATIONSHIP OF
MOVING IT TOWARDS DECREASING
THAT URBAN EDGE, HOW WE HANDLED
THAT ALONG THE STREET.
AND KNOWN MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IDENTIFYING THAT CRITICAL ENTRY
TO THE WHOLE PROJECT, WHICH IS
BETWEEN THE BUILDING PHASE 1 AND
PHASE 2.
YOU CAN SEE IT HERE WHERE THEY
ADDRESSED THAT, ENHANCE THAT
ENTRANCE, IDENTIFIED WHERE THE
RETAIL IS.
IT IS VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE THAT
ARE ACCESSING AND WALKING AND
USING THE ENHANCED BIKE LANE
THAT COMES ALONG FREMONT
BOULEVARD TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS
AND USE ALL OF THAT.
IT ALSO THEN ALLOWS THE
RESIDENCES THOUGH TO COME BACK
INTO THE SITE AND ENTER THEIR
BUILDING OFF OF THAT LITTLE MORE
URBAN ELEMENT AND BE ABLE TO
WORK WITH SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE,
WHILE IT IS VERY TIGHT IN THERE
WE'VE HAD ADDRESSED THAT BOTH
ALONG THE BACK AND ALONG THE
INTERNAL CORE FOR SOME PRIVACY
FOR THE KIDS AND THE FAMILIES IN
THAT AREA.
THE STYLE IS CONTEMPORARY IN
NATURE, BUT I THINK IT WORKS
WELL WITH THE COMMUNITY AS A
WHOLE IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS.
OKAY, YOU'RE DONE?
OKAY THANK YOU.
WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE
PUBLIC AT THIS POINT.
AND HOW MANY SPEAKERS DO WE
HAVE?
VICE CHAIR, WE HAVE SEVEN
SPEAKERS.
Vice Chair Ramamurthi:   OKAY
WE CAN GIVE THREE MINUTES EACH.
AND PLEASE INVITE THEM.
I'LL START WITH THE FIRST
SPEAKER, MICHAEL TICE.
MY QUESTIONS ARE, I HAVE SIX
QUESTIONS.
TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.
ONE, THIS PROJECT IS RELYING ON
SOME GRANTS.
I UNDERSTOOD FROM THE LAST
MEETING.
AND ONE ROUND OF FUNDING WAS TO
BE GRANTED IN MAY, WHICH WAS NOT
RECEIVED.
AND I SUSPECT YOU MIGHT BE THE
ONE TO ANSWER.
WHEN IS THE NEXT ROUND OF
FUNDING EXPECTED FOR THIS
PROJECT FROM THE STATE, COULD
YOU TELL US, DO YOU KNOW?
Vice Chair Ramamurthi:   THEY
WILL HAVE REBUTTAL, THEIR
OPPORTUNITY SO YOU CONTINUE.
YES.
SO THAT'S MY QUESTION, WHEN
IS THE NEXT GRANT COMING.
THE SECOND, ARE THESE GRANTS
STATE MONEY OR IS THERE
GOVERNMENT MONEY INVOLVED, DOES
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESE
GRANTS?
AND A PERSONAL QUESTION.
YOUR OPINION REALLY.
SINCE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,
ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THE CITY OF
FREMONT ALL HAVE CLAIMED
SANCTUARY STATUS, DO YOU
PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT FACT
MAY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR
ABILITY TO RECEIVE THOSE GRANTS?
SO THAT'S -- NOT MEANING TO BE
POLITICAL BUT -- OH I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
GENERALLY MY VOICE CARRIES.
BUT OKAY, SO THOSE ARE MY
QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BUSINESS
PART OF IT.
AND THIRD QUESTION, TOWRT
FOURTHQUESTION WOULD BE, THERE WAS A
STATEMENT OF IMPROVED SIDEWALKS
AND UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
ARE ANY OF THOSE IMPROVED
SIDEWALKS UNDERGROUND UTILITIES
TO BE ON PARISH AVENUE?
THE PARTLY OF PARISH AVENUE THAT
DOES NOT HAVE CURRENT SIDEWALKS
OR UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
SO THAT'S A QUESTION I'D LIKE TO
UNDERSTAND.
SECONDLY, ON THAT TOPIC IS THE
LIGHT.
ARE THERE GOING TO BE LIGHTS,
STOP LIGHTS AT THE CORNER OF
FREMONT AND PARISH AND AT THE
CORNER OF PARISH AND PERALTA?
ARE THOSE IN THE PLANS?
I CAN'T SEE WHERE THAT'S BEEN
DISCUSSED.
AND THE THIRD ONE WOULD BE, ARE
THERE PLANS TO PUT ANY MORE
SPEED BUMPS ON PARISH AVENUE?
THERE IS ONE ON PARISH AVENUE
NOW OR ARE THERE ANY OTHER PLANS
TO PUT ANY ADDITIONAL SPEED
BUMPS ON PARISH AVENUE?
I LIVE RIGHT ON PARISH AVENUE SO
THAT'S A CONCERN FOR ME.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE
SCALA.
PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE
PODIUM.
AND THE APPLICANT.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.
I THINK THIS IS A FINE PROPOSAL
FOR THIS SITE.
I DO HAVE ONE REQUEST, THOUGH,
AND IT IS A REQUEST PRIMARILY
FOR THE APPLICANT BUT ALSO FOR
COMMISSION AND STAFF TO SEE IF
THEY CAN HELP FACILITATE, AND
THAT IS A NUMBER OF LONG TERM
BICYCLE PARKING PLACES.
ZERO.5 PER UNIT WHICH IS WHAT
WE'RE AT COMPLIEZ WITH CODE VERY
WELL AWARE OF THAT.
BUT IT'S ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE
SUBSTANDARD ESPECIALLY FOR AN
AREA IN A TOD, AN AREA, A PLACE
THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE LOW
INCOME FOR MOST PEOPLE CERTAINLY
ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE MUM CARS,
MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE ONE CAR,
DON'T HAVE PARKING FOR EVEN ONE
UNIT AND THIS SITE IS VERY
NICELY ALONG AS MENTIONED BEFORE
BICYCLE CORRIDOR ON FREMONT
BOULEVARD AND THANK YOU FOR THE
APPLICANT AND STAFF FOR DOING A
GOOD JOB OF HELPING TO
FACILITATE THAT.
BUT AS 0.5 LONG TERM PARKING
WHERE WE ARE NOW WE'RE REALLY
FORCING PEOPLE TO KEEP THEIR
BICYCLES IN THEIR LIVING ROOM.
AND AGAIN, WE HEARD, WE EXPECT
FAMILIES TO BE HERE SO WE EXPECT
MORE THAN ONE PERSON PER UNIT.
EVEN IF WE HAD ONE SPOT PER
UNIT, THAT'S STILL REALLY
CUTTING IT VERY CLOSE.
I CAN ALSO SAY THAT THERE WAS --
THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GREEN
BUILDING CODE COMMISSION, IN THE
2025 UPDATE THAT'S ABOUT TO COME
LIVE AND BE PUBLISHED AND AND
TAKING EFFECT IN JANUARY THROUGH
FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT,
STATING THAT THE CURRENT BICYCLE
PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN THE
EXISTING BUILDING CODES JUST DO
NOT MEET THE CURRENT NEEDS FOR
HOW OUR CITIES ARE BEING
DESIGNED.
AND THE TYPE OF BUILDINGS THAT
ARE BEING BUILT THERE.
SO I KNOW WE COMPLETELY COMPLY
WITH THE BUILDING CODES AS OF
TODAY.
BUT IF YOU COULD KINDLY CONSIDER
ANYTHING TO INCREASE THAT
BICYCLE PARKING, I THINK WE WILL
BOTH HELP THE AREA WHERE THIS
BUILDING IS GOING, AS WELL AS
THE -- GOING TO BE AS WELL AS
THE FUTURE RESIDENTS OF THIS
BUILDING SO PLEASE CONSIDER
THAT.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS OSCAR
MAZAREGOS, PLEASE COME TO THE
GOOD EVENING, VICE CHAIR AND
MOASHES OF THE PLANNING
COMMISSION MEMBERS OF THE
PLANNING COMMISSION.
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT, MY
NAME IS OSCAR MAZAREGOS, A
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNION
317.
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE BODY THE
400 MEMBERS THAT RESIDE HERE IN
THE CITY OF FREMONT.
SO THE CARPENTERS UNION HAVE
REACHED OUT TO THE DEVELOPER,
FOR SEVERAL REASONS, U.S.A.
PROPERTY FUNDS AND THEIR OWN
GENERAL CONTRACTING COMPANY
U.S.A. CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
HAS A HISTORY OF HIRING LOW BALL
SUBCONTRACTORS WHO DOUGH NOTE
PAY WAGES AND BENEFITS TO THEIR
WORKERS.
ADDITIONALLY, THE NORCAL COMPANY
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WE
SPEAK HERE TONIGHT.
LET ME BE CLEAR, THE CARPENTERS
UNION SUPPORTS HOUSING AT ALL
LEVELS BUT WE DEEPLY UNDERSTAND
THE COMMUNITY'S NEED TO BUILD
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
OUR MEMBERS BUILD THE LION'S
SHARE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN
THE GREATER BAY AREA.
BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEIZE CITY
LIKE FREMONT AVOID, MORE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT ONLY
BENEFIT DEVELOPERS LIKE U.S.A.
PROPERTY FUND.
WE KNOW CITY OF FREMONT AWARDED
$12 MILLION OF TAXPAYERS MONEY
TO ACQUIRE THIS LAND.
WHAT IS THE CITY OF FREMONT
GETTING IN RETURN?
IS THERE ANY COMMITMENT BY THE
DEVELOPER TO PUT FREMONT
RESIDENTS TO WORK ON THIS
PROJECT?
IF BY SOME MIRACLE A FREMONT
RESIDENT LANDS ON THIS PROJECT
WILL THE INDIVIDUAL BE PAID AN
AREA STANDARD WAGE?
WILL THEY RECEIVE HEALTH CARE,
RETIREMENT, CONTRIBUTIONS, SO IN
CONCLUSION, NORCAL CARPENTERS
UNION OPPOSES THIS PROJECT AS IT
IS CURRENTLY ITERATED.
IN A PERFECT WORLD, A LOAN WOULD
COME WITH LABOR PROTECTION FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO
WILL BUILD THIS HOUSING PROCT.
BEARING A RESOLUTION THAT
REQUIRES PREVAILING WAGES.
THIS PROPOSED PROJECT TONIGHT,
WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO OPEN
DIALOGUE WITH CITY OFFICIALS SO
THE PROJECT DOES NOT JEOPARDIZE
THE LIVING STANDARDS FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THAT BUILD
THEM.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND
SERVICES TONIGHT.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS VIJAY
OBADAYA.
PLEASE COME TO THE PODIUM.
GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE.
I LIVE AT PARISH AVENUE AND I
BELIEVE ALL OF YOU SAID THAT YOU
SPOKE TO RESIDENTS.
I SPOKE TO A COUPLE OF TRENDS
HERE IN PARISH AVENUE AND NONE
OF THEM SAID THAT THEY HAVE
SPOKEN TO ANY OF YOU GUYS.
BUT WITHOUT THAT I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU SPOKE TO A FEW PEOPLE AND
YOU HAVE SURVEYED THE PROPERTY.
AND HERE ARE THE FEW THINGS I
WOULD LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR PROJECT.
FIRST IF YOU LOOK AT THE
INFRASTRUCTURE ON FREMONT
BOULEVARD THERE IS A LOT OF
TRAFFIC.
I WOULD INVITE ALL OF YOU TO
COME THERE ON SUNDAY OR SATURDAY
WHEN THE CHURCH IS GOING.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE PARKING.
IT'S DOUBLE PARKED.
AND NOW WE ARE ADDING 290 MORE
CARS INTO THAT PARTICULAR AREA
WHICH IS THE ENTRY INTO
PREPARISH AVENUE.
IT'S GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE.
SO THAT IS THE FIRST PROBLEM
THAT I HAVE AND I DON'T THINK
THERE IS ANY CONSIDERATION THAT
HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE PROBLEM,
FOR THE LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO HAS
BEEN LIVING THERE FOR 24 YEARS.
THAT'S GOING TO FACE THIS FOR
DAY IN, DAY OUT.
NUMBER 2, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
SCHOOLS WE TALKED TO THE SCHOOLS
AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE --
THEY KNOW THAT ABOUT 140
SCHOOL -- 40 FAMILIES ARE COMING
INTO THAT AREA.
BUT WHAT DEVELOPER TOLD US IS
THAT ABOUT 290 FAMILIES ARE
COMING WHICH MEANS THAT AT LEAST
500 STUDENTS AND I DON'T THINK
THE SCHOOLS ARE PREPARED RIGHT
NOW WHICH IS ALREADY OVERFLOWED
AND CROWDED.
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, ON
PARISH AVENUE WE HAVE BEEN
PAYING PROPERTY TAXES, DOING
THAT FOR 25 YEARS, AFTER GIVING
A LOAN THANK YOU OSCAR FOR
LETTING US KNOW THAT, I THINK
THEY WILL GET AN DPEMTION ON
PROPERTY TAX.
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS, WHY NOT
GIVE IT TO A BUILDER WHO CAN DO
THE TONY HOUSES AND WE CAN
SHRINK THE SIZE.
A BUILDER WHO CAN BUILD THE TOWN
HOUSE WHICH IS IN MUCH LOWER
CAPACITY AND WE CAN SAVE THIS
TRAFFIC PROBLEM, YOU GUYS CAN
GET THE PROPERTY TAXES FROM THAT
AND INVEST IN THE SCHOOLS.
AND I'LL POSIT LAST THING FOR
YOU GUYS.
YOU MAY SAY HEY AFFORDABLE
HOUSING IS NEEDED.
YES ABSOLUTELY NEEDED.
WE HAVE 3159 AFFORDABLE HOUSING
IN FREMONT AND IT SHOULD BE
GIVEN TO ALL OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL
TEACHERS OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND
COPS.
FOR THAT WE HAVE ABOUT 1.7 TO
1.9 PUBLIC HOUSING PER PUBLIC
WORKER.
YES WE HAVE DONE ENOUGH IN
FREMONT.
I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET MORE
PROPERTY TAX, GET A LOWER I
THINK HOUSING UNITS AS COMPARED
TO WHAT WE ARE PUTTING IN PARISH
AVENUE BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT
NOW EQUIPPED IN TERMS OF
INFRASTRUCTURE.
SO I'M ABSOLUTELY OPPOSING TO
THIS PROJECT AND I WOULD LIKE
YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER AND WELCOME
YOU TO COME HERE ON SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF THE
TRAFFIC CONDITION.
[APPLAUSE]
OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOE
MARASPENE.
MY NAME IS JOE MARASPENE I
SERVE AS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE
LOCAL UNION.
CENTERVILLE PLAZA APARTMENTS
LOCATED AT 373 TBHOO FREMONT
BOULEVARD.
CARPENTERS PLAY A VITAL ROLE
WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND
EXPERTISE SPANNING A WIDE PART
OF CENTRAL TASK.
THE CARPENTERS PERFORM THE
MAJORITY OF THE WORK, CARPENTERS
WORK MAKES UP OVER 70% OF THE
WORK ONSITE, FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THE PROJECTS FROM BUILDING
THE FORMS, FOUNDATION, TRAILING
DRYWALL INSULATION, TOORS AND
HARDWARE, ACOUSTICAL CEILINGS,
CAB NOTE INSTALLATIONS AND
INTERIOR FINISHES.
EACH OF THESE ARE CRITICAL TO
THE PROJECT AND ENSURED THAT
EACH ARE BUILT TO THE HIGHEST
STANDARDS OF QUALITY AND SAFETY.
AS A MATTER OF ACCOUNTABILITY
AND RESPONSIBILITY, IT IS
IMPORTANT TO BUILD WITH
RESPONSIBLY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO
REP AND PROVIDE FAIR PAY FOR THE
WORK THAT WAS DONE.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, WHY WERE
THE CARPENTERS LEFT OUT OF THIS
IF WE'RE NOT WORKING WE CAN'T
FEED OUR TEAMS.
IN ADDITION TO FAIR ACCESS TO
WORK, IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO
SURE THAT PROCT LIKE THIS UPHOLD
AREA STANDARD WAGES.
ENSURE THAT WORKERS EARN A FAIR
INCOME FOR THEIR SKILLS AND
LABOR.
ALONG WITH COMPETITIVE PAY
CARPENTERS RECEIVE FULL FAMILY
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND SECURE
PENSION WHICH PROVIDE LONG TERM
STABILITY AND PEACE OF MIND.
THESE BENEFITS AREN'T JUST PEACE
OF MIND WHERE WORKERS CAN
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES, RETIRE
IN DIG NITZ AFTER A LIFETIME OF
SERVICE.
INVEST IN TRAINED WORKFORCE
THAISH INVESTING IN THE LONG
TEMP SUCCESSFUL, SUCCESS OF THE
PROJECT AND THE COMMUNITY IT
SERVES.
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO
BETTER.
LET'S ENSURE THAT WE ARE
RESPONSIBLE, FAIR, AND STAND BY
THE WORK-E AND THEIR FAMILIES.
I URGE THIS PLANNING COMMISSION
TO TAKE ACTION TO ENSURE THAT
THE CARPENTERS HAVE A FAIR WAGE
AND ARE PAID FOR THE CRITICAL
WORK THEY DO.
I ALSO OPPOSE THIS PROJECT AS IT
STANDS.
NEXT SPEAKER, LAURA WINTER.
GOOD EVENING, COMMISSION.
MY NAME IS LAURA WINTER.
I'M A NEIGHBOR OF THIS PROPOSED
FORTUNATELY I LIVE ABOUT 325
FEET AWAY BECAUSE I DID NOT
RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION ABOUT THE
COMMUNITY MEETING AND DID NOT
GET AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT.
I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
SPEAK WITH MR. WILLIS EARLIER
THIS WEEK AND GOT SOME OF THE
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
BUT STILL HAVE SOME INFORMATION
TO ASK OF YOU ALL.
I'VE LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR 30-SOMETHING YEARS AND HAVE
MY LIFESTYLE, AND IT JUST WITH
ALL THE CHANGES I WAS THERE LONG
BEFORE IT WAS CONSIDERED A
TRANSIT ORIENTED DISTRICT.
AND SO THE CHANGES THAT ARE NOW
HAPPENING IMPACT I AND MY
NEIGHBORS A GREAT DEAL.
BECAUSE OUR LIFESTYLE AS WE
ALREADY HAVE GOOD JOBS AND IT'S
NOT ALONG THE TRAIN TRACKS.
AND SO WE STILL NEED TO BE ABLE
TO DRIVE AND GET AROUND.
ONE OF THE REQUESTS, A COUPLE OF
THE REQUESTS THAT I WOULD HAVE
IN RELATION TO THAT, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT IS DESPERATELY
LACKING IN CENTERVILLE IS ANY
KIND OF GROCERY STORE.
ANY KIND OF MARKET WHERE WE CAN,
YOU KNOW, GET A QUART OF MILK
AND A HEAD OF LETTUCE ON FRIDAY
NIGHT WHEN WE GET HOME FROM WORK
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT FOR A WALK
AND I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THAT
FOR A WHILE.
SO I WOULD ASK THAT POSSIBLY THE
RETAIL AREA BE USED FOR SOME
KIND OF MARKET, THAT WOULD HELP
NOT ONLY THE NEW RESIDENTS BUT
THE EXISTING RESIDENTS OF THE
AREA.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE -- ON THE
STAFF REPORT PAGE 5 IT TALKS
ABOUT LAND USE, POLICY 2-3.5, IS
THAT BALANCE OF SERVICES
AMENITIES AND USES AND THAT IT
MINIMIZE THE DISTANCE A RESIDENT
MUST TRAVEL TO REACH BASIC
SERVICES SUCH AS SHOPPING.
THAT'S NOT IN CENTERVILLE.
WE ARE A FOOD DESERT AND IT
WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF YOU
GUYS WORKED WITH THE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO GET
I'M ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF TIME.
SO ALSO IF YOU COULD ASK THE
DEVELOPER TO, WHEN THEY CREATE
PHASE 2 OR PHASE 1, TO COMPLETE
THE ENTIRE STREET IMPROVEMENTS
ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD SO THAT
THOSE RESIDENTS CAN ACCESS, HAVE
THE WIDE SIDEWALK, AND STUFF, TO
REACH THE TRAIN STATION.
IF YOU JUST DO IT TO THERE, IN
FRONT OF PHASE 1, IT'S NOT GOING
TO -- YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO BE
POOR QUALITY GETTING THERE AND
BACK.
SO I'M SURE I HAD OTHER STUFF
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY
ABREU.
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMISSION
PROFESS THEIR DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF
WELL, I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THAT
FIRST PROJECT THAT CAME UP,
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
THREE, FOUR, FIVE YEARS AGO.
AND THE STAFF DOESN'T WANT US TO
TALK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH BECAUSE
THEY WANT US TO KEEP LOOKING
FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE AND NOT
ASK HOW WE GOT HERE.
HOW WE GOT TO SUCH A PROJECT.
BACK THEN, THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY
ROSE UP AND ROOM WAS FULL,
PEOPLE WERE MAKING HUGE DEMANDS,
EXAGGERATED DEMANDS, THEY
DEMANDED THE MOON AND THEY GOT
IT.
THEY DEMANDED UNDERGROUND
PARKING, THE MOST INCREDIBLY
COSTLY PROFLIGATE FORM OF
PARKING THERE IS IN URBAN
CIVILIZATION, AN OUTRAGEOUS
THING YOU CAN BARELY AFFORD IN
MANHATTAN AND HERE WE ARE
SUPPOSED TO DO IT IN FREMONT.
THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
HISTORIC MURAL, ARGUMENTS ABOUT
TRAIN NOISE DECIBELS, EVERYBODY
WAS A TECHNICAL EXPERT ABOUT
NOISE FROM THE TRAINS AND HOW TO
OVERCOMB THAT.
AND NOW WE HAVE A TOWN CENTER
ZONING WHICH REQUIRES
PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED RIGHT?
THAT ENTIRE FRONT OF THE
BUILDING IS DEAD, FAKE FRONT,
MOST OF IT.
PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE
WALKING IN AND OUT OF THAT
BUILDING, LIKE MISSION SAN JOSE,
WHERE THE ENTIRE OFFICES, ALL
OFFICES ARE ACCESSED FROM THE
BACK, AND YOU DEACTIVATED
MISSION BOULEVARD.
YOU ARE MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE
HERE.
ALL THOSE PROMISES WERE MADE
BECAUSE YOU KNEW AS SOON AS YOU
BULLDOZED THAT OLD COMMERCIAL
STRIP MALL AND YOU CREATE THAT
LOT, AFTER YOU CREATE THAT
DESERT THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO
BE BEATEN DOWN, THEY ARE GOING
TO TAKE WHATEVER CRUMBS OF
DEVELOPMENT, WHATEVER LOUSY
PROJECT PROPOSAL COMES UP IT'S
BETTER THAN AN EMPTY LOT.
THE KEY IS TO MAKE THAT AN EMPTY
LOT, CREATE THE DESERT AND AFTER
THAT ANYTHING GOES.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE
WHAT'S -- THIS PROJECT IS ONE
HALF OF THE LAND AREA THERE IS
PARKING.
ON THIS PROJECT.
OKAY?
THIS TYPICAL FREMONT MOVE.
TO CREATE A GIANT PARKING LOT
AND PRETONED LIKE IT'S HOUSING.
-- AND PRETEND LIKE IT'S
HOUSING.
ACTIVATING THE AREA IS
IMPOSSIBLE IN FREMONT TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES, PEOPLE
WALKING INTO AND OUT OF
BUILDINGS OWN A MAJOR THOROUGH
ATMOSPHERE, NO YOU PUT UP FAKE
WINDOWS, PUT UP FACADES, PUT UP
THINGS, YOU ARE WALKING ALONG
THE BLANK WALL.
THERE IS NO HUMAN ENTRANCE
THERE.
IT CAN'T BE DONE THERE, WE ARE
GOING TO DEACTIVATE OUR MAJOR
CORRIDORS IN THE NAME OF
PRETTINESS OR SECURITY OR PUBLIC
SAFETY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
EXCUSE IS ABOUT IT IS CERTAINLY
NOT PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED, THANK
NEXT SPEAKER, SAVRA SHARMA,
PLEASE, COME TO THE PODIUM.
HELLO, THANK YOU FOR HAVING
ME.
THANK YOU EVERYBODY.
I'M A BUSINESS OWNER RIGHT
ACROSS THE PARKWAY, AND YOU KNOW
AS THE COMMISSIONER SAID, I
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY IN THAT
AREA OR HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY
FROM THE DEVELOPMENT FROM THE
COMMISSIONER SIDE TO COME AND
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE BUSINESS OR
THE NEW DEVELOPMENT.
WE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT PUTTING
THE LINES, PUTTING THE LEAD OR
GETTING THE CAST COME TO FREMONT
BOULEVARD BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN
THE FREMONT BOULEVARD FROM 2 TO
5 P.M.
IT IS A PARKING LOT AT THAT
POINT.
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE TRAIN TRACKS
GO DOWN, IT IS A HUGE PARKING
LOT AT THAT POINT.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GO WITH THAT
SITUATION FOR THIS?
AND WITH THE PAPERWORK THAT WE
GOT IT SAID 3,000 SCARE FEET BUT
I'M HEARING IT'S 5100 SQUARE
FEET FOR THE COMMERCIALLY ESTATE
WHICH IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHICH
IS LIKE A 2100 SQUARE FEET
DIFFERENCE THERE.
AND WHEN WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL
REAL ESTATE IT NEEDS A PARKING
LOT TOO.
WHERE ARE THOSE CARS GOING TO
END UP?
AND WITH THE PARKING SITUATION
WITH THE BUILDING, WE ARE ADDING
LIKE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT
FLOORS FOR PARKING LOT.
WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMERCIAL STATE
IT NEEDS PARKING LOT AND YOU
NEED A PARKING LOT FOR
RESIDENTS.
SO THE EXTRA CARS ARE GOING TO
SPILL OVER TO THE RESIDENTIAL
AREA OR THE EXISTING BUILDING
AREAS WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE
AWAY THE PARKING SPACES WHICH
ARE ALREADY VERY MINIMUM, JUST
ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS THERE.
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE ARE
ADDRESSING THOSE SITUATIONS
THROUGH TO THE PARKING LOT
SITUATION THERE?
AND BECAUSE THE STREET IS
ALREADY A BIG PARKING LOT THERE
AND IT'S A SPEEDY PARKING LOT
AND YES, THAT'S MY -- MY BIG
CONCERN IS IF YOU ARE ADDING
MORE FAMILIES ARE THE SCHOOLS
ABLE TO HANDLE THOSE KIDS THERE?
BECAUSE THERE -- IT IS A HUGE
AREA WHERE THE KIDS WALK AROUND
TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE
HIGH SCHOOL THERE, ARE THE
SCHOOLS ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THOSE
KIDS, WHERE ARE HOSE KIDS GOING
TO BE?
BECAUSE THEY JUST RECENTLY DID
THE CENTERVILLE HIGH SCHOOL
THERE, IS IT GOING TO BE BIGGER,
IS IT A BIG PARKING LOT AND THE
IS KIDS GOING TO GO THERE?
THAT IS THE BUGGEST CONCERNS,
VICE CLAIRE, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE SPEAKERS.
RICHMOND THANK YOU.
Vice Chair Ramamurthi: THANK YOU.
AT THIS POINT WE WOULD LIKE THE
APPLICANT COME BACK FOR REBUTTAL
AND WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES.
I THINK -- THANK YOU,
COMMISSIONERS, I THINK I CAN
SPEAK TO SOME OF THESE, PROBABLY
ALL OF THEM.
BUT WITH RESPECT TO LET'S SEE IF
I CAN READ MY OWN HANDWRITING ON
MY NOTES.
WE ARE UNDERGROUNDING A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UTILITIES
ALONG PARISH AVENUE, ALL THE
UTILITIES WILL BE PLACED
UNDERGROUND, THE JASON WAY
SIDEWALK WILL BE REPAIRED AND
REBUILT.
WE'RE DEDICATING LAND ALONG THE
PHASE 2 PORTION OF JASON WAY TO
EXTEND IT TO MAKE IT BIGGER AND
THAT'S A COMPLETE IMPROVEMENT
WITH NEW SIDEWALKS.
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT WATER
LINE UPGRADE OWN PERALTA AVENUE,
THAT WILL BE PART OF PHASE 2 IN
ORDER TO GET THE WATER FLOW AND
THE WATER CAPACITY SIGNIFICANT,
LINEAL FEET OF UPGRADING ON
THERE SO WE'RE WILLING TO DO
THAT NOT TO MENTION EVERYTHING
ELSE THAT GOES ALONG WITH
PREPARING A PROJECT SUCH AS
THIS.
BIKE PARKING I THINK IS A GOOD
IDEA.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE TOO
MUCH BIKE PARKING.
SO WE CAN LOOK AT THAT.
IF WE CAN PROVIDE MORE BIKE
PARKING AS POSSIBLE.
LET'S SEE.
I THINK THE GROCERY STORE IS A
FANTASTIC IDEA.
WE HAVE -- WE REALLY, YOU KNOW,
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE MARKET
WILL DEMAND AND WE CAN'T SPEAK
TO WHAT WILL ACTUALLY GO INTO
THAT SPACE.
BUT I THINK THE CONSTRUCTION
TIME LINE IS AT LEAST, YOU KNOW,
A YEAR AND A HALF, TWO YEARS
FROM NOW.
SO WHO KNOWS WHAT THE MARKET
WILL LOOK LIKE THEN.
BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA
AND I DEFINITELY HAVE NOTED
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, PARKING IS
ALWAYS AN ISSUE.
AND I THINK JAMES MENTIONED THIS
PROJECT REQUIRES NO PARKING.
BUT WE'RE PROVIDING PARKING.
WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING RETAIL
PARKING SO SOME SPACES WILL BE
DESIGNATED FOR RETAIL ONLY,
WE'RE PROVIDING 50% OF THESE
SPOTS WILL BE EV CHARGERS.
THAT COMBINED WITH BIKE PARKING
COMBINED WITH TRANSIT ORIENTED
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT UP THE STREET
MAKES US CONFIDENT THAT FROM A
FUNCTIONAL STANDPOINT PARKING
WILL WORK.
SO I HEAR THE COMMENTS OF THE
AND WE'VE TRIED TO MITIGATE THAT
AS BEST WE CAN.
BEFORE I OPEN UP THE FLOW FOR
COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS AND ASK
QUESTIONS, I WOULD LIKE TO
INTRODUCE COMMISSIONER CHARLES
LIU WHO JOINED US.
LITTLE LATE.
Commissioner Liu:   I'LL JUST
SAY I DROVE BY THE SITE AND DID
NOT SPEAK TO ANYONE TO MAKE MY
DISCLOSURE.
RIGHT, SO I OPEN THE FLOW TO THE
COMMISSIONERS TO ASK QUESTIONS.
Commissioner Yee:   THANK
YOU, VICE CHAIR.
I GUESS YOU KNOW HEARING WHAT
THE PUBLIC IS SAYING, I GUESS
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GUESS I'M
GOING TO ASK, IS REGARDING, AND
I THINK STAFF COULD PROBABLY
ANSWER THIS, IS THE -- FROM THE
PREVIOUS PROJECT, YOU KNOW, WITH
THE ISSUES WITH THE ACE TRAIN
THAT IS NEARBY, THERE WAS THE
ISSUES OF YOU KNOW SOUND
MITIGATION FOR THE ORIGINAL
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT
HAVE THE SOUND MITIGATION BEEN
SATISFIED TO THE STANDARDS?
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT
WAS DONE FOR THE PROJECT
DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL
WORK WAS NECESSARY.
THE EFFECT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL
NOISE ON THE PROJECT IS NOT
NECESSARILY A CEQA ISSUE.
HOWEVER, THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS
FOR IT TO MEET BUILDING CODE
STANDARDS FOR NOISE LEVELS
WITHIN THE UNITS.
AND THE NOISE ANALYSIS THAT WAS
DONE DETERMINED THAT WITH THE
DESIGN OF THE BUILDINGS BEING
DIFFERENT THAN THE LOWER TOWN
HOMES THAT THE BUILDINGS SERVE
TO BLOCK QUITE A BIT OF THE
NOISE FROM EACH OTHER.
AND THE STANDARD NOISE RATED
WINDOWS WOULD BE ABLE TO
SUFFICE.
Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I WAS
READING THAT.
JUST TO CLARIFY, SO THAT THE
PUBLIC CAN HEAR THAT.
I GUESS THE OR THE THING TOO I
WANTED TO ASK, YOU KNOW, JAMES,
IS THE ISSUE OF TRAFFIC.
ABECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE
BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW THAT
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CLUB
HAVE ALREADY SHARED WITH US.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US, I SEIZE
THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND
MAYBE GO INTO DETAIL WITH THAT.
BECAUSE YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS
PROJECT IN TERMS OF THE
CALCULATIONS TO THE CURRENT ONE
THERE IS A REDUCTION, I BELIEVE
IT IS ABOUT 8% REDUCTION.
IF YOU CAN GO INTO A LITTLE, YOU
KNOW EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW YOU
GUYS DO THE CALCULATIONS FOR
THAT TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T
REALLY IMPACT THE SURROUNDING
WE DO HAVE MEMBERS OF OUR
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING STAFF
HERE THAT COULD PROBABLY ANSWER
THE QUESTION BETTER THAN I
COULD.
THERE IS A -- THERE WAS A
TRAFFIC ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE
FOR THE PREVIOUS PROJECT.
AND THIS PROJECT IS UTILIZING
THE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS THAT WAS
DONE FOR THAT ONE.
SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE SOME OF
OUR TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS TO
COME UPPER TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION DIRECTLY.
Commissioner Yee:   OKAY,
GREAT, THANK YOU.
HELLO, EXERTIONS, MY NAME IS
ALEXANDER, I'M A TRANSPORTATION
ENGINEER CITY OF FREMONT.
AS JAMES MENTIONED, PREVIOUSLY
FOR THE PREVIOUS PROJECT, THERE
WAS A TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS
FORMED, AND SINCE THEN, THE
CHANGE TO THE PROJECT, ACTUALLY
REDUCED THE TRIPS LARGELY
BECAUSE THE RETAIL OR COMMERCIAL
SQUARE FOOTAGE WAS REDUCED.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, THE CURRENT
PROJECT WILL GENERATE ENSURE
..
IT LOOKED FREQUENT YOUR
CALCULATIONS IT WAS 2100.
IT IS 1800, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
RENTAL.
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
DAILY TRIP, FULL-DAY TRIPS.
IT IS A BIT LARGE HERE PERCENT
REDUCTION FOR DAILY TRIPS.
..I WAS FOCUSING ON THE
EIGHT-HOUR TRIP SWISS A
ABSOLUTELY LESS REDUCTION THAN
THE DAILY TRIPS.
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF ANY
OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU
SINCE YOU'RE HERE, FOR TRAFFIC
ENGINEERING.
WHAT ABOUT -- BECAUSE I KNOW
AFTER TALKING TO HOLY SPIRIT,
YOU KNOW, WAS THERE ANY
DISCUSSION WITH THEM TO
DETERMINE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
SCHOOL PICK UP AND DROP OFF AND
HOW THAT MAY IMPACT THIS
PARTICULAR PROJECT?
I DIDN'T DISCUSS IT WITH
THEM, HOWEVER, WE PERFORM SOME
OBSERVATIONS IN TERMS OF
CROPPING OFF CHILDREN IN THE
MORNING AND WE DID NOT OBSERVE
SIGNIFICANT QUEUING AT THE
INTERSECTIONS IN THE A.M. HOUR
ME WHAT ABOUT, THEY SHARED WITH
ME, KNOW, WE KNOW HOW PARENTS
DRIVE.
THEY'RE IN A RUSH.
MAYBE THERE IS NOT MUCH QUEUING
BUT WHEN YOU DID AN OBSERVATION,
IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY SPEEDING,
GOING DOWN PARISH AND SOME OF
THE OTHER SIDE STREETS THAT ARE
WHAT WE OBSERVE IS THAT THE
PRIMARY ACCESS INTO THE SCHOOL
WAS OFF CENTER, SO FREMONT AND
CENTER INTERSECTION THAT IS A
SIGNALIZED INTERSECTION AND
PRIMARY ACCESS THERE WAS SERVED
BY THAT LEFT TURN THAT IS
PROTECTED LEFT TURN.
SO THERE WAS VERY MINIMAL TURNS
INTO PARISH FROM FREMONT.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
REGARDING THIS.
I TRAVEL ON THAT ROAD EVERY DAY,
AND THERE IS A TRAIN CROSSING,
AND THAT IS THE ONLY, OTHER THAN
THE ONE, IT IS THE MAIN STREET
THROUGH NORTH FREMONT AND
CENTRAL AND IT WOULD TAKE A FEW
YEARS, 10 MINUTES FOR ME TO GO
ARDENWOOD AREA TO THERE BUT NOW
DOUBLE THE TIME BECAUSE THE
LANES ARE OLD AND THERE IS LIKE
REALLY TRAFFIC AND THEN THE
TRAIN CROSSES THEY END UP
SPENDING MORE TIME.
SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS ARE
TALKING ABOUT, AND I WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY IF YOU HAD ACTUALLY
DONE THE TRAFFIC ANALYSIS AGAIN.
BECAUSE WHAT YOU DID FOR THE
PREVIOUS PROJECT, HERE WE HAVE
INCREASED NUMBER OF UNITS, THAT
MEANS MORE CARS, MORE FAMILY
MEMBERS, MORE CARS, SO YOU JUST
SIMPLY CANNOT -- IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY STONES USE THE PREVIOUS
STUDY.
I DO MAKE SENSE?  DO YOU AGREE
WITH ME?
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE
WITH YOU ON.
THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT TRIPS
GENERATED AND DIFFERENT USERS
GENERATE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF
TRIPS.
FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THIS SPECIFIC
PROJECT, WE INCREASED THE NUMBER
OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS, HOWEVER WE
DRAMATICALLY DECREASED THE
SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR THE RETAIL OR
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH
ALSO GENERATES A LOT OF TRIPS.
SO, ON BALANCE, THERE WAS A
SLIGHT REDUCTION IN TRIPS.
SO I CAN SAY THAT.
SO VICE CHAIR, IF I MAY, JUST
ADD TO WHAT ALEX HAS SAID.
WE DID PERFORM TRAFFIC ANALYSIS.
WE DO HAVE QUALIFIED TRAFFIC
ENGINEERS IN HOUSE, ERIC AND
ALEX HERE.
WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU AND
ACTUALLY TRAFFIC STUDY OR A FULL
TRAFFIC STUDY FROM A CONSULTANT
IS ONES WE FARM OUT.
IF WE CANNOT DO IT IN HOUSE, WE
WOULD, DEFEND ON CAPACITY, HAVE
A CONSULTANT DO IT BUT THAT
ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCT FORD THE
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE SAID IT
WAS NOT BEES ARE NOT FOR THIS
ARE YOU SAYING THE PREVIOUS
PROJECTS ANALYSIS.
CORRECT INTO CORRECT ME IF
I'M WRONG.
THE PREVIOUS TRAFFIC STUDY
INFORMED THE CURRENT TRAFFIC
ANALYSIS DONE BY STAFF.
JUST TO CLARIFY, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I HAD MENTIONED.
LOOKING AT THE ORIGINAL STUDY,
WHICH WAS OVER 2100 DAILY TRIPS
AND ALL THE SUDDEN NOW YOU HAVE
NUT ONE AND THAT ONE SHOWS ABOUT
1800 SO THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT
ONES.
THAT IS WHY I SAID IT IS ROUGHLY
8, 9% REDUCTION IN TERMS OF THE
DAILY TRIPS.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO GET
CLARITY FOR, FOR THE PUBLIC, SO
THAT WHEN THE ORIGINAL PROJECT
WAS APPROVED BACK IN, I HAD TO
TAKE A LOOK BECAUSE I THINK I'M
ONE OF THE FEW PLANNING
COMMISSIONERS THAT WAS STILL
THERE EARLY ON, SIX YEARS AGO IN
FEBRUARY OF 2019, WHEN IT WAS
APPROVED BACK THEN, THAT WAS FOR
THE HIGHER DAILY TRIPS.
AND THEN NOW, YOU'RE WITH THIS
NEW DESIGN IS ACTUALLY LOWER FOR
AM I CORRECT, ALEX?
THAT'S CORRECT.
THE CALCULATIONS FOR THE CURRENT
PROJECT IDENTIFY MORE LEVEL OF
TRIPS FOR DAILY A.M. AND P.M.
PEAK HOURS INTO OKAY, I JUST
WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT.
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION
BEFORE YOU CALL ON OTHER
COMMISSIONERS.
THIS IS REGARDING THE
CARPENTER'S UNION.
AND THIS IS FUNDED BY THE CITY,
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE GIVEN.
USUALLY I WAS TOLD THAT WE
CANNOT IMPOSE AND SAY, HEY, YOU
HAVE TO HIRE THE UNION PEOPLE,
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT,
SINCE WE ARE FUNDING THE
CITIZENS OF THE CITY ARE FUNDING
THIS PROJECT, CAN WE PUT A
STIPULATION, YOU HAVE TO HIRE
UNION PEOPLE?
SO I JUST TO CLARIFY THAT.
THE $12.85 MILLION OF LOCAL
FUNDING THAT WAS ADDED TO THIS
PROJECT IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE
GAP IS ACTUALLY NOT TAXPAYER
DOLLAR FUNDS.
THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT IN LEW
FEE, AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT IN
LIEU FEE THAT WE COLLECT FROM
MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS.
THIS PROJECT WAS ONE OF THREE
PROJECTS DURING THE 2023 COMPETE
TOUGH FUNDING ABILITY PROCESS WE
HELD IN THE CITY COUNCIL BASES
ON THE MERIT AND LOCATION AND
WHAT THE NUMBER OF TOTAL THE
AFFORDABLE UNITS THIS PROJECT IS
PROVIDING AS WELL AS THE AM OF
MONEY PER UNIT TO BUILD THE
PROJECT, IT WAS SELECTED AS ONE
OF THREE PROJECT TO BE FUNDED.
THE QUESTION ABOUT PREVAILING
WAGES THAT QUESTION IS NOT FOR
PLANNING COMMISSION, WE CANNOT
LEGALLY REQUIRE IT.
IF THE DEVELOPER IS GOING AFTER
OTHER FUNDINGS THEY'RE LEGALLY
REQUIRED TO PAY PREVAILING
WANTS, THAT'S ON THEM.
BUT FROM THE CITY STANDPOINT, WE
DON'T HAVE A LOCAL POLICY.
WHAT IS BEFORE THE PLANNING
COMMISSION TONIGHT JUST THE
DESIGN REVIEW APPLICATION, THE
SUBDIVISION AND THE WAIVERS
REQUESTED SO THAT IS WHAT YOU
SHOULD FOCUS ON.
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY
QUESTION.
I INVITE COMMISSIONER CRAIG
NEXT.
QUICKLY ON THE TRAFFIC STUDY, I
KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS
PROJECT BUT BASED ON WHAT IT WAS
GOING TO BE, SINCE IT WAS GOING
TO BE TOWN HOMES AND STUFF THAT
PROBABLY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE
CARS PER UNIT, LIKE THE TOWN
HOMES PROBABLY HAD LIKE TWO OR
SOMETHING, SO AND THEN SINCE
THIS DOESN'T HAVE LIKE ONE CAR
PER UNIT, IT IS JUST UNDER THAT,
I THINK, THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IS
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS BECAUSE IT IS
GOING LIKE 25,000 SQUARE FEET
DOWN TO 5 BUT THEN THE MARKET
ARE SPACES FOR THE RESIDENTIAL
SIDE, DID THAT DECREASE OR STAY
ABOUT THE SAME FOR THE
RESIDENTIAL SIDE?
THE PARKING STANDARDS HAVE
CHANGED SINCE THE ORIGINAL
PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED.
UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW, THE
CITY IS NOT ALLOWED TO EVEN
REQUIRE PARKING FOR A
DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE
TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT
SO THE CURRENT CITY CODES
REFLECT THAT.
ALL THE PARKING SPACES BEING
PROPOSE BID APPLICANT OF
VOLUNTARY.
YEAH, I'M THINKING OF IT FROM
A, LIKE, HOW MUCH TRAFFIC, HOW
MUCH ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC THERE IS
GOING TO BE, LIKE ON THE ROAD.
SO, LIKE, IF IT'S -- I KNOW WE
CAN'T MANDATE HOW MANY PARKING
SAYSES THEY HAVE BUT THEY'VE
SAID THIS IS HOW MANY THERE ARE
AND I'M CURIOUS IF YOU REMEMBER
HOW MANY WERE PART OF THE LAST
PLANNING.
IF YOU'RE ASKING HOW MANY
PROPOSED PARKING SPACES WITH THE
FORMER PROJECT THAT DID NOT
PENCIL, OBVIOUSLY.
RIGHT.
WE DON'T HAVE THAT AT THE
FOOD IS THAT'S FINE.
WE CAN FOLLOW UP.
I WOULD ASSUME IT MIGHT HAVE A
LITTLE MORE IT HAD STRUCTURED
PARKING AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE
REASON WHY IS THE DEVELOPER
DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD AS
COMMISSIONER YEE POINTED OUT.
IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A
STRUCTURED GARAGE.
MY ASSUMPTION WAS THAT IT WAS
THE SAME OR HIGHER AMOUNT OF
PARKING, SO IF THE RETAIL
TRAFFIC IS LOWER, THEN HAVING
FEWER PARKING SPACES MEANS THERE
IS ALSO LESS TRAFFIC FROM THE
RESIDENTIAL SIDE.
THANKS.
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?  NONE?
YEAH, I HEARD THERE IS THREE
ACCESS POINTS FOR THE THREE
STREETS.
FREMONT BOULEVARD, JASON WAY,
NO, FREMONT BOULEVARD, PARISH
AND PERATTA.
SO THERE IS AN ACCESS POINT ON
JASON WAY, CORRECT?  I SEE, YES?
I SAW THAT ON JASON WAY THERE
WAS ALREADY A CUT OUT FOR A
DRIVEWAY SO THEY'RE GOING TO
PROBABLY FILL THAT IN IS WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.
JASON WAY IS GOING TO STAY WHAT
IT IS RIGHT NOW?
THE AREA OF JASON WAY THAT IS
SUB STANDARD, THERE IS AN
EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY THAT GOES
OUT TO PERATTA THAT GOES PAST A
NARROW PART, THAT AREA WILL BE
DEDICATED FOR ADDITIONAL WIDTH
FOR RIGHT OF WAY ON THE
APPLICANT SIDE OF THE PROPERTY,
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT CONFORMING
RIGHT OF WAY.
THEN, IMPROVEMENTS WOULD COME AS
PART OF THAT.
OKAY, SO IF THAT HAPPENS,
THAT MEANS THE RESIDENTS THAT
LIVE ALONG JASON WAY WILL HAVE A
BETTER WAY TO ACCESS IT OFF OF
PERATTA.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
CURRENTLY, I AM NOT SURE A
VEHICLE WOULD FIT DOWN JASON
WAY.
IF THE IMPROVEMENT IS DONE,
IS IT ACTUALLY WIDE ENOUGH FOR
VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO GO
THROUGH THERE IN.
I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A
STANDARD CITY STREET.
COMMISSIONER LIU.
I NEVER ASKED THE QUESTION --
WE CLOSE THAT OR CAN I ASK IT?
EVEN THOUGH WE CANNOT REQUIRE
THE NUMBER WE HAVE, HOW DID YOU
COME UP WITH THE NUMBER OF
PARKING PER UNIT.
IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF
ADDING A LITTLE BIT MORE
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS I
EXPERIENCED IN OTHER
HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING, ONE OF THE
COMMON COMPLAINTS FROM RESIDENTS
IS THAT IF THEY HAVE ANY GUESTS
AT ALL, IT JUST IS SO HARD FOR
THEM TO FIND PARKING AND IT
USUALLY CREATES A LOT OF
TENSIONS AND THE HOAs MAY HIRE
THESE TOWING COMPANIES WHO ARE
JUST, YOU KNOW, WATCHING AND
JUST WAITING FOR ANY ILLEGAL
PARKING, EVEN ON AN EMERGENCY
BASIS.
BARELY AFTER 10 MINUTES, THEY
COME TO THE -- THEY COME TO THE
CAR AND TOW IT AND IT JUST
CREATES A LOT OF TENSION AMONG
THE RESIDENCES.
SO JUST FOR THE FUTURE PEACE AND
PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE, THE NEW
RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE
EXISTING RESIDENTS IN MY
PERSONAL OPINION, IF THERE IS
ANYWAY YOU CAN INCREASES NUMBER
OF PARKINGS AVAILABLE BY LOOKING
AT THE RESOURCES, I KNOW IT IS
QUITE LIMITED, IS THERE ANYWAY
YOU CAN INCREASE THAT?
SO PARKING IS ALWAYS THE
BIGGEST PROBLEM, ALWAYS.
SO, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE DESIGN
OUR PROJECTS WE LOOK AT THE
DENSITY WE NEED TO GET IN ORDER
TO MAKE THE PROJECT PENCILLABLE
AND WE WORK ON THAT FACE AND
BASS WARDS FROM THERE WE HAVE TO
INCORPORATE WATER CONTROL
LEVELS.
ONCE THAT IS INCORPORATED, WE
REFINE THE PROJECT BASED ON THE
UNITS WE NEED, THE CITY'S GOALS
AND THE PARKING PAYSES FALL IN
PLACE AND IT HAS TO BE A MEASURE
WE CAN WORK WITH, WITH OUR
PROJECT IN THE THIS CASE WE
DESIGN THE BUILDING.
WE LOST SPACE BECAUSE OF STORM
WATER CONTROL AREAS.
THE UNDER GROUND LINES, WE HAVE
TO PUT IN SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
WHICH TAKES UP VALUABLE REAL
ESTATE.
WE ENDED UP WITH THE 257 SPACES,
YOU THINK,S AND THAT IS A
FORMULA WE WORKED IN OTHER
PROJECTS WE OWN AND THAT HAS
WORKED.
WHEN PEOPLE LEASE OUR UNITS, WE
INFORM THEM, YOU GET ONE SPOT OR
MAKE NOT ANY SPOTS.
THERE IS NO HOA.
YOU MENTIONED AN HOA SO IN OUR
PARENTS THERE NO HOA SO WE OWN
IT AND TREND OUT TO FOLKS.
WE COMBINE THAT CAN THAT
CRITERIA, AND THE BOOK PARKING
THAN A TO DID, TRANSIT
DEVELOPMENT AREA, YOU CAN GET TO
THE TRAIN IT N IS A HOT TOPIC,
GET MORE PEOPLE TO USE PUBLIC
TRANSIT.
IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD
PROVIDE ALL THE PARK BUG IT IS A
FINE DANCE TO WIDDLE IT DOWN TO
THE AM OF PARKING THAT WORKS FOR
THE PROJECT AS WELL AS
MINIMIZING THE IMPACT ON THE
COMMUNITY.
TRANSIT IS A TRAIN STATION
THAT GOES TO LIMITED PLACES THAT
PEOPLE NEED TO LIVE A REAL LIFE.
IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU CAN DESIGN
THE COMMERCIAL SPACE WITH THE
ESSENTIAL NECESSITIES AND NEEDS
IN MIND, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW,
ACCOMMODATING A GROCERY STORE.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT, AT LEAST
THAT PEOPLE CAN REDUCE THE
NUMBER OF TRIPS AND JUST WALK TO
THAT STORE AND LIVE THERE.
AND THAT CAN REALLY MAKE IT A
MORE OF A PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY
SO --
I THINK THE LAST YOU THINK I
WOULD SAY ABOUT THE PARKING IS
FIRE ACCESS HAS TO GET INTO THE
PARKING, AS WELL.
THEY HAVE TO SQUEEZE BY, WE
TRIED TO GET MORE PARKING.
AT THIS TIME, THE DESIGN WE
HAVE, THE PARKING IS MAXIMIZED.
I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS.
THIS IS FOR THE APPLICANT.
I WAS TRYING TO CATCH HIM BEFORE
HE HAD TO SIT BACK DOWN.
I NEED -- SORRY.
I'VE GOOD COUPLE QUESTIONS
DIRECTED AT YOU.
CAN YOU ELABORATE TO ME ABOUT
THE CONSTRUCTION FOR THIS
PROJECT?  IF IT IS APPROVED.
BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT IS ALL ABOUT
CAN YOU MAYBE, YOU KNOW, SHARE
WITH THE PUBLIC HERE HOW DO YOU
PLAN TO DO THIS, BECAUSE THAT IS
TWO PHASES TO THIS CONSTRUCTION
AND HOW THOSE CONSTRUCTION
TRUCKS AND THE WORKERS, HOW ARE
THEY ALL GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET
IN THERE, KNOW, FULL WELL THAT
I'VE BEEN DOWN ON FREMONT
BOULEVARD WHERE IT DOES LOOK
LIKE A PARKING LOT.
I RIDE MY BICYCLE THROUGH THERE
TO GET THROUGH FASTER AND SEE,
AND MY NEPHEW WENT TO HOLY
SPIRIT SO I KNOW HAVING TO DROP
HIM OFF AND PICK HIM UP.
IF YOU CAN ELAP RATE HOW YOU'RE
PLANNING TO DO THAT AND
ELIMINATE OR MITIGATE ANY
POTENTIAL TRAFFIC ISSUES WITH
THIS CONSTRUCTION.
IT IS MITIGATE BID CITY.
A LOT OF OUR CONDITIONS OF
APPROVAL WITH HOURS, DUST
CONTROL, ALL THOSE THINGS.
IF WE HAVE TO PUT DOWN A LOAN,
WE TRY TO MINIMIZE ANY DOWN TIME
OF STREETS WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE
OR TWO TO UNDER GROUND THE POWER
LINES.
IT CAN BE INCONVENIENT AT TIMES,
BUT WE TRY TO MAKES THAT MINIMAL
AT POSSIBLE.
FOR STAGING, FOR EXAMPLE, PHASE
TWO IS A GREAT OPTION.
THE PHASE TWO LAND, TO STAY
TUNED EQUIPMENT TO KEEP IT OUT
OF THE STREET.
THAT IS AN OPTION AND WILL
PROBABLY BE THE WAY WE GO.
AS WE GO TO CONSTRUCTION WE TRY
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO THE
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING TO DO USE THAT SECOND
PHASE AREA AS A STAGING AREA.
MY OTHER QUESTION IS, YOU DID
GUYS GO DOWN FREMONT BOULEVARD
AND TAKE A LOOK AT ARTIST WALK.
I THOUGHT SO.
WE LOOK THAT THE PROJECT AND THE
CENTER LANES IS SIMILAR TO THE
ARTIST WALK, AS WELL.
I'M ASSUMING YOU WENT DROWN TO
TAKE A LOOK AND SEE HOW YOU CAN
BLEND YOUR PROJECT WITH THE
EXISTING PROJECTS OUT THERE, AS
WELL.
YEAH, YEAH, WE TOURED THE
UNITS THERE TO GET IDEAS OF HOW
TO DO OUR PROJECT.
IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
IT IS NOT A HORRIBLE PROJECT BUT
THERE ARE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS
TO IT.
WE LOOKED AT AND IT OTHER
PROJECTS, TOO.
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR
YOU, SOFT RE.
WAITING FOR YOU TO SIT DOWN AND
CALL YOU BACK UP.
NO PROBLEM.
JUST THINKING ABOUT THE BIKE
I KNOW YOU GUYS PROVIDING A FAIR
BIT AND STUFF, BUT I THINK THIS
-- THESE PLACES DON'T HAVE
BALCONIES, THEY DON'T HAVE LIKE
A LOT OF STORAGE SPACE FOR THEM,
SO THERE'S WAYS MAYBE TO BE ABLE
TO JUST LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS
TO ADD MORE BOOK PARKING, SINCE
THERE ARE FEWER VEHICLES AND
TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TAKE
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
THERE ARE BUS STOPS NEAR THE
TRAIN STATION, AS WELL, BUT
WE'VE GOT THAT BIKE CORRIDOR LOO
AND BEING ABLE TO USE THAT AND
ALLOW DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING
ABLE TO GET AROUND.
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
WE DID LOOK AT THAT.
THERE IS A HANDFUL MORE WE COULD
SQUEEZE IN THERE SHUFFLING
CABINETS AROUND AND PLUMBING
EQUIPMENT ROOMS.
EVERYTHING IS SQUEEZED IN BUT WE
COULD DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT IF
THAT IS A FAIR ANSWER, I THINK
WE COULD SQUEEZE SOME MORE IN
THANK YOU AM COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS MOSTLY FOR CITY STAFF.
SO I LIVE UP ON THE NORTH SIDE
OF FREMONT, AND I SORT OF TRAVEL
THAT CORRIDOR PRETTY OFTEN.
I HAVE TRAVELED IT ON THE
WEEKENDS.
I HAVE GONE TO PICK UP TAKEOUT
AT SOME OF THE RESTAURANTS THAT
ARE THERE AND TRY TO LIKE PARK
ON WHAT USED TO BE THE CINEMA, I
THINK IT IS NOW A BASKETBALL GYM
SIDE OF THE STREET AND PEOPLE
ARE HONKING AT YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE TAKING TO MINUTE TO TRY
PARALLEL MARK.
IF YOU CAN TAKE MARKING THERE
AND WALK FORWARD, THEN PARISH,
AS WELL, WHEN I WAS REAL YOUNG,
BEFORE WE HAD A WORSHIP PAYS OF
OUR OWN, WE USED TO RENT ONE OF
THE COMMUNITY CENTERS OVER THERE
BETWEEN PERATTA AND FREMONT, SO
I KNOW THAT AREA, THE SAYSLER
USED TO BE THERE.
THAT CORRIDOR IS REALLY TIGHT.
BETWEEN THE RAILROAD TRACK AND
CENTRAL.
THEY'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE FOR
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE TEST.
I WONDER IF THERE IS ANYTHING AT
OUR DISPOSAL ON THE
TRANSPORTATION SIDE THAT COULD
HELP EASE THE STRAIN WITH THE
ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE THINK ABOUT
SIGNAL LIGHT TIMING, SIGNAGE
WITH STRIPING DIRECTING CARS IN
A CERTAIN DIRECTION.
SO OUTSIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT
AND SORT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
WITH THE PARKING AND ALL THE
VARIOUS OTHER THINGS, I HEAR
WHAT FOLKS ARE SAYING WHO LIVE
ON THE PARISH SIDE.
I HEAR KIND OF THE MERCHANT
COMMUNITY THAT IS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE PARKING ON THEIR SIDE
OF THE STREET, AS WELL.
JUST KIND OF CURIOUS, WHAT TOOLS
DO WE HAVE IN OUR TOOL BOX AND
IS THERE ANYTHING WE COULD BE
THINKING ABOUT FROM THE CITY
STANDPOINT TO KIND OF HELP EASE
THAT A LITTLE BIT, AGAIN OUTSIDE
OF MAYBE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH
THE DEVELOPMENT ITSELF IN TERMS
OF THE LAYOUT AND ALL THAT SORT
OF STUFF.
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT?
YEAH, MAYBE I CAN SPEAK TO.
THAT FIRST OF AIL, ERIC HUGH,
PRINCIPLE TRANSPORTATION
ENGINEER WITH THE CITY OF
FREMONT THERE HAS BEEN
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PLANNING
AND PROJECT AND INVESTMENTS FROM
THE CITY BOTH IN TERMS OF THE
CITY TRANSPORTATION FUNDS AS
WELL AS SECURING REGIONAL,
FEDERAL AND STATE GRANT FUNDS TO
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE
PROJECTS.
BUT THE IDEA FOR FREMONT
BOULEVARD IN GENERAL,
SPECIFICALLY FROM DAKOTA ROAD
ALL THE WAY TO DOWNTOWN, WHICH
COVERED CENTERVILLE, TOWN CENTER
AREA IS TO MAKE IT VERY MULTI
MODAL, EFFICIENT, BOTH FOR --
AND OBVIOUSLY SAFE AND
ULTIMATELY IN OUR OPINION, THE
BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS COMFORTABLE
FOR PEOPLE TO USE ACTIVE
TRANSPORTATION.
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ENTIRE
FREMONT CORRIDOR IS A PRIOR
DEVELOPMENT CORRIDOR, A PRIOR
DEVELOPMENT AREA.
THINGS ARE TO BE MORE DENSE OVER
TIME.
AS PART OF THE URBAN PLANNING,
THE TRANSPORTATION
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE MORE
-- LESS ABOUT -- IT IS GOING TO
BE MORE ABOUT EFFICIENCY BUT
ALSO TO MAXIMIZE PEOPLE THROUGH
PUT, RIGHT?  NOT NECESSARILY
VEHICULAR THROUGH-PUT BECAUSE
THAT IS CONSTRAINED BY THE
ROADWAY, NUMBER OF LANES AND
CLASS BUT JUST TO GIVE THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THROUGH OTHER
TRANSIT OR WALKING AND BOOKING,
NEWS TO MAKING THE VEHICLE
TRAFFIC AS POSSIBLE.
WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING THERE FOR
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS ON
MULTIPLE FRONTS.
NAL OPERATIONS, THAT IS ONE OF
THE MORE RECENT ONES.
WE COORDINATED ALL OF OUR
TRAFFIC SIGNALS ALONG FREMONT
BOULEVARD THE INTERSECTION
THROUGH CENTERVILLE, TOWN
CENTER, THROUGH THIS AREA ALL
THE WAY DOWN IRVINGTON AND
BEYOND.
NOW, ADMITTEDLY, THE BENEFIT OF
SIGNAL COORDINATION IS NOT GOING
TO BE AS READILY APPARENT DURING
THE A.M. PEAK WHEN THERE IS THE
TRAFFIC VOLUME AND JUST THE
SCHOOL-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND
TRAFFIC AND JUST SAY ALL
INDICATE I DON'T SAY ASSOCIATED
WITH IT.
RIGHT?  PEOPLE DROPPING OFF KIDS
ON ONE SIDE OF THE STREET AND
KIDS JUST DART ACROSS THE
FREMONT BOULEVARD, WHICH WILL
OBVIOUSLY IMPACT TRAFFIC AS WELL
AT OTHER CROSSING GUARD
POTENTIALLY, CROSSING STUDENTS
OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF A
TRAFFIC SIGNAL, FOR EXAMPLE.
THOSE ARE ALL VARIABLES THAT
WILL LEFTABLEY IMPACT THE --
THAT WILL INEVITABLY IMPACT THE
TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL.
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'VE
CONDUCTED THE FIELD DATA
COLLECTION DURING THE OFF-PEAK
TAMES, WEEKEND TIMES, AND TO A
CERTAIN DEGREE THE PEAK TIMES,
AS WELL, THE TRAFFIC FLOW IS
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED
TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE NEWEST
CITY DEVELOPED COORDINATION
PLANNING TIME HAS BEEN AVOIDED.
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT
FREMONT BULL REGARD.
EVEN PRIOR TO SIGNAL TIMING
CHANGES, WE ALL KNOW AND WE'VE
PROBABLY ALL DONE IT OURSELVES
USED PASEO PADRE, FOR EXAMPLE,
AS BY-PASS TO GET FROM NORTHERN
TOWN, OR NORTH OF THE CITY, DOWN
TO FREMONT, DOWNTOWN.
SO WE TIME THAT CORRIDOR, AS
IN FACT, AGAIN, MOST OF THE TIME
YOU CAN GET FROM ONE SIDE OF THE
-- YOU KNOW, PASEO PADRE ALL THE
WAY TO DOWNTOWN WITH MAYBE ONE
RED LIGHT EXPERIENCE.
IF YOU DRIVE AT THE DESIGNED
SPEED.
AND SO YEAH, SO THAT'S JUST FROM
A SIGNAL OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT.
YOU GUYS AS RESIDENTS PROBABLY
EXPERIENCED AND WITNESSES A LOT
OF INTERSECTION SAFETY
IMPROVEMENTS, INTERSECTION
THROUGHOUT FREMONT BOULEVARD.
THE BIKEWAY THAT WAS COMPLETED.
WE HAVE ACTUALLY GOING INTO
CONSTRUCTION THIS SUMMER TO
EXTEND THAT BIKE WAY SOUTH OF
FREMONT BOULEVARD AND WE HAVE A
PROJECT RIGHT NOW FULLY FUNNELED
THAT IS IN DESIGN, BASICALLY TO
EXTEND THAT SIDEWALK LEVEL BIKE
WAY, STARTING THE EYE
GENE/GRIMMER INTERSECTION
WASHINGTON DRIVE IN FRONT OF
WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.
AND TECHNICALLY THE PROJECT HAS
ALREADY BROKEN GROUND BUT THIS
SUMMER YOU WILL SEE ADDITIONAL
SIDEWALK LEVEL BIKEWAY BEING
CONSTRUCTED IN THIS AREA, FROM
FREMONT BOULEVARD FROM THORNTON
TO PERATTA.
WITH ADDITIONAL BIKE LANES BEING
STRIPED, AS WELL.
SO THE ULTIMATE CORRIDOR IS
PLANNED FOR AS BEST AS WE CAN
DESIGN, FIT, AND ALSO TO SECURE
FUNDING FOR IS WHAT WE CALL AN
ALL AGENT ABILITY BIKEWAY
NETWORK.
THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS, LIKE YOU
SAID THE SPACE IS SO CONSTRAINED
GO IT MINES SORT OF HAVING
SEPARATE BIKE FACILE TIME OUT
HAVE A 14-FOOT WIDE, 15-FOOT
WIDE SIDEWALK AREA THAT WILL BE
SHARED, SO TO SPEAK, TO FIT IT,
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL,
ALL THOSE DESIGN ELEMENTS ARE ON
THE TAKEN BASED ON SITE
CONDITIONS.
COMBINED ABOUT INTERSECTION
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO GET AT
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
NECESSARILY EXPERIENCED RIDERS
AND COMMUTERS GET THEM
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO WALK AND
BIKE TO DOWNTOWN UNTIL THE
GROCERY STORE IN THIS AREA IS
COMING TO FRUITION.
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL.
AND, AS THINGS DENSIFY AS THE
TRAFFIC LEVEL CONTINUES TO
INCREASE AND THIS IS JUST A
PROGRESSION OF TRANSPORTATION
PLANNING IS AS PART OF OUR
SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROGRAM WE
ALREADY HAVE THE EQUIPMENT IN
PLACE TO EVENTUALLY FACILITATE
WHAT THEY CALL TRANSIT SIGNAL
PRIORITY OR TRANSIT PRIORITY
IMPROVEMENTS TO GET ADDITIONAL
BUS RELIABILITY AND RESPONSE AND
TRAVEL TIME THROUGH THAT
CORRIDOR.
THAT'SES NEXT LEVEL UP.
IF YOU CANNOT SQUEEZE MORE CARS,
SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES AND
PASSENGER CARS, THESE MAKE THE
BUSS ABOUTS MORE RELIABILITY AND
THEY CAN HOLD MORE PEOPLE PER
VEHICLE, SO TO SPEAK, THAN
NORMAL PASSENGER CARS.
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER STREETS IN
THE BAY AREA, THEY INSTALLED
EXPRESS BUS SERVICE FROM OAKLAND
DOWN TO HAYWARD, I THINK.
AND THEY HAD A SIMILAR EVOLUTION
BY THEIR DENSITY FAR GREATER
THAN OURS AT THIS TIME.
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE OVERAIL
VISION.
SOME HAVE ALREADY BEEN
IMPLEMENTED, SOME ARE IN THE
PROCESS AND SOME ARE BEING
PLANNED IN THE FUTURE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I THINK THAT IS ALL GREAT, WE
TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE WORK
SESSION A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WOULD
ASK US TO BE THINKING ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR NOT EVEN CORN BIER THE
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE
COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF PERATTA
AND THE ODDITY THAT COMES WITH
THE RAILROAD ARM THAT GOES UP
AND DOWN OVER THERE AND ALL THE
SORT OF RELATED IMPLICATIONS YOU
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE,
FROM THE CITY SIDE, ARE ABLE TO
BRING A LITTLE MORE FOCUS AS
THIS DEVELOPMENT, I THINK YOU
SAID, MIKE, LIKE TWO YEARS TO
CON CONSTRUCTION OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME FROM OUR SIDE TO THINK
ABOUT HOW WE CAN ADD SOME TOOLS
FROM OUR TOOL BOX TO EASE SOME
THINGS WE'RE HEARING FROM THE
I ADVISE WE TAKE THAT INTO
CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF A
FOCAL AREA.
I CAN SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE
BIT.
WHEN WE DID THE SIGNAL
COORDINATION, SPECIFICALLY IN
THIS AREA, THERE WAS A COUPLE OF
THINGS WE HAD TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.
ONE IS A RAILROAD CROSSING, AND
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THE
ABILITY TO CONTROL THE IMPACT ON
THE RAILROAD CROSSING WHEN
ACTIVATED HAS ON THE OVERALL
OBVIOUSLY THE RAILROAD CROSSING
ITSELF, THE OPERATION IS
SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE TRAFFIC
SIGNAL ON SITUATION, IN THIS
INDICATE AT FREMONT AND PERATTA
FOR SAFETY PURPOSES, SAFETY
REASONS.
BUT OUR COMING PLAN DOES TRY TO
ACCOMMODATE THAT OR AT LEAST
PLAN FOR THAT.
WE ALSO DO -- SORRY.
WE HAVE ACTUALLY SEPARATE
PROJECTS, AS WELL, AS PART OF
THE REAL CROFTING SAFETY
ENHANCEMENT TO IMPROVE THE BIKE
AND PED SAFETY, AS WELL.
THERE IS UP OR ACE TRAIN, THERE
ARE OTHER PROJECTS ON THEIR END
OR REGIONALLY THAT COULD HAVE
IMPACT OR CHANGES TO THE
FREQUENCY OF THE RAIL, THE RAIL
ACTIVITY ALONG THIS PARTICULAR
LINE, WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE
IMPACT TO THIS CASE SURFACE
STREET OPERATION FROM FREMONT
SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROJECTS,
PROGRAMS, DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE
HAPPENING ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL,
AS WELL THAT ULTIMATELY HAS
LOCAL IMPACT IN THIS AREA.
BUT WE DO HAVE DESIGN ALREADY,
ALONG THIS CORRIDOR, THIS
SECTION OF THE CORRIDOR, WE DID
FORWARD TO THE DEVELOPER IN THIS
CASE SO A LOT OF THE FRINGE
IMPROVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE
BIKEWAYS, THOSE ARE BASED ON
CITY DESIGN FOR OUR BIKEWAYS.
SO IN THIS CASE THEY'RE ABLE TO
HELP THE CITY BUILD A PORTION OF
THIS FRONTAGE BIKEWAYS, SO TO
SPEAK.
SO A LOT OF THINGS ARE STILL IN
MOTION, BUT THAT'S TO YOUR
POINT, THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO
TAKE, YOU KNOW, CONSTANTLY
AWARENESS AND CONSTANT ACTION
ON.
I HAVE A QUESTION.
VICE CHAIR, SORRY TO
INTERRUPT BUT IT IS A LITTLE
AFTER 8:30.
WE STILL HAVE A CAPTIONER THAT
NEEDS TO TAKE A BREAK.
FOR 10 MINUTES?  FIVE
MINUTES?  10 MINUTES.
OKAY, LET'S TAKE BREAK FOR 10
MINUTES, AND DON'T GO ANYWHERE,
I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
[BREAK]
[NO AUDIO]
.
.SECONDLY, PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW
WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A NUMBER
OF AFFORDABLE HOMES IN THE CITY.
THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT AND IT
IS MEETING LOW INCOME AND IT
PROVIDES A LOT OF PARKING AND IT
IS RIGHT NEXTS TO THE TRAIN
STATION.
THIS IS PERFECT FOR US AND WE
NEED IT.
I UNDERSTAND, I FEEL YOUR PAIN
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC, BUT WE HAVE
TO HAVE THIS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE
REQUIRED TO MEET THIS DEMAND
FROM THE STATE AND ALSO TO MAKE
IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE TO LIVE
IN FREMONT.
THAT IS JUST MY THOUGHT.
ANYONE ELSE THAT WANTS TO SHARE
ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I REQUEST
FOR A MOTION?  NO?  OKAY.
I WOULD LIKE AT THIS POINT TO
REQUEST A MOTION TO APPROVE THIS
I'LL MAKE A MOTION.
ANY SECONDS?
I WILL SECOND.
LET'S VOTE.
FIVE YAYS AND ONE ABSTAIN.
AND THE MOTION PASSES.
WE APPROVE THIS PROJECT.
THANK YOU, VICE CHAIR.
IF I COULD SAY A FEW BOARDS,
AGAIN THE VOTE 5-0-1-1 AND THE
PROJECT HAS BEEN APPROVED.
THE PLAN COMMISSION'S DECISION
TO APPROVE THIS ITEM TO FINAL
UNLESS IT IS APPEALED TO STOCK
SPLIT COUNCIL WITHIN 10 CALENDAR
DAYS.
VICE CHAIR, BACK TO YOU, AND WE
MIGHT WANT TO INVITE CHAIR
BASRAI.
WE WANT TO GET HER BACK IN.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER ITEMS ON
THE AGENDA?
THAT IS IT.
AND THERE'S -- REALLY FROM A
STAFF PERSPECTIVE, WE HAVE
NOTHING NEW TO SHARE WITH THE
PLANNING COMMISSION OTHER THAN
THE NEXT REGULARLY-SCHEDULED
HEARING WILL OCCUR ON JUNE 26.
WITH THAT --
I HAVE ONE UPDATE.
EARLIER LAST MONTH, I CAN'T
BELIEVE TO SAY EARLIER LAST
MONTH DURING ASIAN HERITAGE
MONTH, THE FORMER MAYOR AND I,
WE CO-HOSTED THE ASIAN HER STAND
FESTIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO BAY
UNIVERSITY.
JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE HAD A
LITTLE OVER 2,000 PEOPLE SHOW U
UP.
OH YEAH.
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY TWO
ONE, WE HAD THE LOCAL PORSCHE
DEALERSHIP PUT OUT THE CARS SO
PEOPLE COULD TAKE PICTURES AND
VIDEO.
BUT I THINK FOR US GUYS, CLIFF,
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW, I KNOW
JILL DID, WE HAVE PARADOX, ONE
OF THE NEW BARBERSHOPS IN
CAPITAL NEAR CITY HALL, WE HAVE
A BOOTH AND GRAVE FREE HAIRCUTS
TO THE MEN ALL FOUR HOURS THEY
WERE THERE.
THEY HAD A LINE, LITERALLY, OUT
THE DOOR WITH THAT, I WANTED TO
SHARE WITH YOU.
WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL -- I
THINK NEXT YEAR, WE WILL GO FOR
3,000 PLUS PEOPLE.
VERY NICE.
ANYTHING PRESSLEY ANY OTHER
COMMISSIONERS?  WITH THAT, WE
WILL ADJOURN THE MEETING AT 9
