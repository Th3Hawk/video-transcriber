MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY
WE BELIEVE THAT JUSTICE IS ONLY REAL IF IT REACHES
EVERY
CORNER OF OUR COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY THOSE
WHO MAY STRUGGLE TO
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. ELDER
AND DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE
OFTEN HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT. IT CAN
TAKE THE FORM OF PHYSICAL HARM
, EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION, FINANCIAL EXPORTATION, OR NEGLECT.
ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STUDIES,
NEARLY HALF OF ELDER MISTREATMENT
VICTIMS REPORTED SPOUSE OR
FAMILY MEMBER AS THE PERPETRATOR.
AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS, OVER 64%
OF STAFF SURVEYED ADMIT
TO SOME FORM OF ABUSE AGAINST OLDER ADULTS.
THESE ARE NOT JUST STATISTICS, THESE
ARE CALLS FOR ACTION.
OUR OFFICE IS RESPONDING WITH URGENCY AND COMPASSION

OUR OFFICE SUPPORTED 2818 NEW VICTIMS
,
A MEANINGFUL INCREASE THAT REFLECTS OUR RENEWED COMMITMENT
TO OUTREACH AND SURVIVOR CENTER JUSTICE.
OUR WORK DOESN'T STOP AT THE COURT
ROOM. THAT'S WHY WE WORK IN CLOSE
PARTNERSHIP WITH ADULT PROTECTIVE

WRONGDOING, BUT TO HEAL HARM, RESTORE DIGNITY, AND
ENSURE LONG-TERM SAFETY.

, FAITH AND COMMUNITY LEADERS ARE SPREADING AWARENESS
AND POLICYMAKERS LIKE YOU ALL CONTINUING TO INVEST
IN PREVENTATIVE RESOURCES.
WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EYE OUT FOR RED

NEGLECT, SUDDEN CHANGES IN FINANCES,
OR THAT UNEXPLAINED INVOLVEMENT
OF A NEW FRIEND OR CARETAKER,
BY LEARNING THESE SIGNS AND SPEAKING
UP WE CAN INTERRUPT CYCLES OF ABUSE
AND ENSURE ELDERS GET THE PROTECTION
THEY NEED. AT THE HEART OF THIS WORK
A SIMPLE, POWERFUL PRINCIPAL
. LISTEN TO SURVIVORS. BELIEVE THEM. SUPPORT THEM,
RESPECT THEIR AUTONOMY. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM
MUST NEVER
BE A BARRIER TO DIGNITY. IT MUST BE A
BRIDGE TO SAFETY AND
RESPECT. AGAIN, THANK YOU

AND FOR
YOUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF
ATTORNEY URSULA JONES DIXON, WHO HAS MADE

IN ALAMEDA
COUNTY LIVE FREE FROM FEAR WITH
THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEY HAVE
EARNED OVER A LIFETIME. THANK YOU.

FROM
POSSESSING GUNS, AND STOPPING THE SPREAD OF
A TRACEABLE FIREARM.

FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE.
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR
YOUR SUPPORT AND DEDICATION AND FOR RECOGNIZING
NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY.
AND WE WILL INVITE YOU OVER FOR
A PHOTO TOGETHER. AND WE HAVE A FEW SPEAKERS.
THERE WE GO.
THREE, TWO, AND ONE. GOT IT.
MICHELLE, WE
HAVE A FEW SPEAKERS, RIGHT?
YES, I HAVE TWO SPEAKERS LIPS. ONE OF THEM
WAS TURNED IN ON ZOOM, IT WAS
CYNTHIA, THAT PERSON IS NOT IN ZOOM RIGHT
NOW, SO WE'LL TAKE THE ONE THAT
WE HAVE HERE IN PERSON, THAT'S MIKE GRANT.
GOOD EVENING,
48 YEARS UNDER THE ATF.
ONE DEATH IS TOO MUCH.
I WONDER WHY THIS COUNCIL DOESN'T
RECOGNIZE OTHER GROUPS WITH A PROCLAMATION,
LIKE CAR ACCIDENTS, 42,000 A YEAR THAT
I, 178,000 DIE
FROM ALCOHOL RELATED IN THE UNITED STATES.
480 DIE
FROM SMOKING RELATED DEATHS. WE ALL HAVE
, AND THEY HAVE MANY LAWS ON
THE BOOKS FOR THAT.
BUT,
NOTHING THE AMOUNT OF GUN LAWS THAT
ARE ON THE BOOKS IN THIS
COUNTRY, 20,000 GUN LAWS, FEDERAL,
STATE, AND LOCAL. SO I ASKED THE QUESTION, ARE THEY WORKING?
FIREARM SAFETY
IS JUST NOT A TRIGGER LOCK, IT'S GOING INTO DEPTH
WITH TRAINING PEOPLE HOW TO HANDLE
A FIREARM SAFELY, KNOWING IF
IT'S UNLOADED, AND I'VE BEEN TO THIS
COUNCIL MANY TIMES TELLING YOU THAT YOU
NEED
TO START DOING THIS IN THIS TOWN,
BUT YOU DON'T. THE TRUE GUN SAFETY
, MORE GUN LAWS WILL NOT DO
IT. EDUCATION DOES IT. THESE
ANTI-GUN GROUPS, WHICH WERE JUST UP, AMONGST
EVERY TOWN
FOR GUN SAFETY COLLECTS $187 MILLION A YEAR.
YET, NONE OF THEM DO ANY
FIREARM TRAINING AT ALL.
THEY HAND OUT TRIGGER LOCKS. PLUS,
THEY TAKE A LOT OF THAT MONEY
AND THEY'RE RUNNING INTO THE LEGISLATION,
I HAVE A COMPLETE
LIST OF THEIR FORM 990S, JUST FILLED
WITH POLITICIANS. LOCALS, TOO.
THE GIFFORD LAWRENCE CENTER GETS
10 MILLION. NO TRAINING. BRADY CENTER,
11 MILLION, NO TRAINING. NOW,
THE PRO-GUN GROUPS, THE NRA, HAS MANY TRAINING CLASSES.
HUNTING
AND SAFETY PROGRAMS FOR THE CHILDREN, OVER
120,000 INSTRUCTORS IN THIS COUNTRY.
I'M ONE OF THEM.
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THE DOJ,
HAS FIREARMS TRAINERS, 4000 OF THEM.
I'M ONE OF THEM. ALL
GUN OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE AN FSC TEST
PASSED 23 QUESTIONS OUT OF 30 , AND
SEVEN OF THOSE QUESTIONS
ARE KEEPING YOUR GUNS LOCKED UP, AND
THEY SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT ON IT. SO
WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COUNCIL TO DO
IS TO MAKE ONE OF
THESE ROOMS AVAILABLE, THE MANY THAT WE
HAVE IN THE TOWN THAT YOU TRY TO RENT
TO US AND YOU GOT TO BE A 401, A 501(C) TO
GET IT FREE,
TO GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY LIKE MYSELF
SO I CAN PUT ON A TRUE
FIREARMS TRAINING CLASS FOR THE CHILDREN
AND THE ADULTS ON
HOW TO HANDLE, NO WITH A GUN IS LOADED OR
UNLOADED.
THIS CLASS WILL COVER MANY
THINGS, AND THERE'S NO LIVE GUNS IN THE
CLASS, THERE WILL BE NO WEAPONS
ON THE CITY PROPERTIES.
WE HAVE PLASTIC GUNS, BUT I THINK
IT'S TIME THAT
YOU GUYS WAKE UP AND REALIZE IF MORE GUN
LAWS ARE NOT GOING TO
MAKE IT, WE'VE GOT ENOUGH ON THE BOOKS.
I
SUPPORT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO,
BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO COME
TO THE REALISTIC VERSION THAT EDUCATION
IS WHERE IT'S AT. THANK
YOU.
THAT'S THE ONLY SPEAKER, I DID GET A
RESPONSE BACK FROM THE OTHER SPEAKER AND
THAT
PERSON HAS LOST THEIR VOICE AND WILL NOT
BE MAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ZOOM
TONIGHT.
YOU WANT TO RESPOND? GO AHEAD.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
A QUICK ASKED. WE NOW HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO
LIGHT CITY HALL IN
COLORS AS WELL, CORRECT?
CORRECT.
COULD WE LIGHT CITY HALL
IN ORANGE AS WELL AS THE WAY THIS YEAR?
WE CAN. PERFECT. WONDERFUL.
MARSHA HAS A COMMENT, PLEASE.
ARE ALSO DOING HALF THE MONTH IN PURPLE
FOR ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH. IT'LL
BE ORANGE AND PURPLE.
I LOVE IT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PERFECT.
SO, 3.4,

THE WEAR ORANGE TEAM.
A BIG THANK YOU TO

GOOD NEWS.
SO,
WE HAVE AGENDA ITEM FOUR, NOW, FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
AT THIS TIME, THE PUBLIC IS PERMITTED TO ADDRESS
THE CITY COUNCIL ON NON-AGENDIZED ITEMS.
PLEASE STEP TO THE PODIUM
AND CLEARLY STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD.
COMMENTS SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE MINUTES.
DO WE HAVE COMMENTS?
WE DO, MAYOR,
I HAVE FIVE SPEAKERS.
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS MIKE GRANT.
AGAIN, MIKE GRANT, AND UNDILUTED
FIREARMS TRAINING IN TOWN. I'VE COME
TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THAT
THE DPS PUT ON.
FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE CITIZENS.
I WANT TO COMMEND THEM, CHIEF FOX
AND COLLEEN FOR PUTTING THAT TOGETHER, IT'S GREAT.
I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT THEY SHOULD PROBABLY,
THE CITY CITIZENS SHOULD SEE
, A LITTLE BIT MORE OF,
WHAT WE GET FOR THE BANG FOR THE BUCK
AND THAT
HAS TO DO WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME
UP HERE YEARS AGO, AND
WERE AGAINST BASICALLY US
USING THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT, AND THEY WANTED TO
START LOOKING AT OTHER AVENUES GOING
OUT AND GETTING
OUR OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS
VERY EXPENSIVE. I DON'T THINK THEY
REALIZE EXACTLY WHAT WE GET FOR THE DOLLAR
THAT WE SPEND WITH THEM, AND HAVE
ALL THIS EXTRA
COVERAGE. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT WE PUT SOME OF THAT OUT TO THEM,
I UNDERSTAND
IN THE FUTURE HERE, THREE TO FIVE YEARS OUT
WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A CONTRACT DUE AGAIN, I
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS IT , AND IF
THEY
HAVEN'T TAKEN THAT CLASS, AND YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF COMMITTEE TOGETHER, THEY
ARE NOT
ON THE COMMITTEE, THEY NEED TO TAKE
THAT CLASS AND SEE WHAT THESE GUYS
DO EVERY DAY TO KEEP THIS CITY SAFE.
THE LAST THING IS COLLEEN ATTENDED
THAT, AND I WANT YOU ALL
TO KNOW HER CALLSIGN,
WAS ONE ADAM 12. SHE DIDN'T LIKE THAT, BUT
THAT'S WHAT WE CALLED
HER WHEN WE WERE IN THE CARS. JUST
THOUGHT
I'D PASS THAT ON TO YOU. THANK YOU,
COLLEEN.
THANK YOU. MAYOR,
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SHERRY LEWANDOWSKI.
MAYOR, COUNCIL MEMBERS AND STAFF.
LONGTIME DUBLIN RESIDENT.
RECENTLY, MY HUSBAND AND I DROVE DOWN SOUTH
INTERSTATE
HIGHWAY FIVE. TO VISIT FRIENDS AND
AFTER DRIVING A COUPLE
HUNDRED MILES, WE REALIZE THAT INTERSTATE
TWO LANES IN ONE DIRECTION,
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. SO
I'M WONDERING, WHY WOULD DUBLIN PROPOSE
TO BUILD A SIX LANE TO FOUR-LANE EXPRESS AREA
FOR JUST
A MILE AND A HALF?
STRETCH OF ROAD TO CONNECT DUBLIN
TO ROBER MOORE, AT A COST OF
$160 MILLION ACCORDING TO THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION
REPORT. REALLY? 100
50 MILLION?
FOR JUST A MILE AND A HALF?
A COUPLE MEETINGS AGO I
SHOWED YOU THIS DEPICTION OF AN ALTERNATE ROAD DESIGN.
IT'S TAKING TWO EXISTING ROADS ALREADY,
AND YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO BUILD A
THIRD OF
A MILE ROAD TO CONNECT THOSE TWO. IT ACCOMPLISHES THE
ACTUAL
OPEN SPACE INITIATIVE OF CONNECTING DUBLIN
TO LIVERMORE.
IF YOU ADD
A BIKE LANE AND A PEDESTRIAN LANE
THIS COST IS GOING TO BE UNDER $50
MILLION. THAT'S A LOT LESS THAN THE
160 MILLION. THIS ALTERNATE DESIGN
FULFILLS THE FACT THAT IT CAN
CONNECT TO TWO CITIES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH LANDOWNER
PROPERTIES, FIVE OF
THEM YOU DON'T NEED TO ANNEX UNINCORPORATED LAND
FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, SO
DUBLIN'S
URBAN LIMIT IS GOING TO BE MAINTAINED.
THERE IS NO
REAL IMPACT TO ENVIRONMENT AND THE
WILDLIFE, AND WE SAVE OPEN SPACE.
LIVERMORE WILL NOT GIVE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT
FOR THIS ROLE BECAUSE IT INCLUDES
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE
ROAD ACROSS THE PROPERTY.
THAT LEAVES DUBLIN WITH
A FULL RESPONSIBILITY, THE WHOLE 160 MILLION.
THE CITY'S FINANCIAL SHOWS THAT IT
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS DESIGN.
THE CITIES ALREADY TAKEN MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OUT
OF THE GENERAL FUND.
AS A LOAN TO THE TRAP'S IMPACT FEE
FUND, IN
ORDER TO JUMPSTART THE PROJECT.
BUT, HOW TO PAY BACK THAT LOAN AND
PAY BACK THE BALANCE FOR THE
COST OF THE ROAD ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AND NOT CONFIRMED.
THE REASON THE SIMPLE TWO LANE ROAD
WAS NOT CONSIDERED IS BECAUSE IT
DIDN'T MEET THE PROFIT OBJECTIVES
OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND DEVELOPERS. BUT
IT
DOES MEET THE RESIDENTS FINANCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES.
THE PROPERTY
OWNERS AND DEVELOPERS WANT THE CITY'S MULTILANE ROAD
BECAUSE THEY WILL PROFIT A
LOT FROM IT. AND YET, THEY'RE NOT
WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. WHY
NOT? DOESN'T SEEM FAIR. IN MY OPINION,
THE CITY SPENDING $160 MILLION
FOR A SHORT ONE AND A HALF MILE ROAD
DOESN'T MAKE
FINANCIAL SENSE. AND NOT A GOOD USE OF PUBLIC MONEY.
GIVEN THERE'S A MAJOR FREEWAY ONLY
1200 FEET IN PARALLEL TO IT.
THE MORE IMPORTANT ROAD IMPROVEMENT
NEEDED IN OUR CITY
TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT
THAT SIX OR 60 MILLION SHOULD
BE USED WITH THE BENEFIT OF DUBLIN RESIDENCE. THANK YOU.
MAYOR,
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS NORM LEWANDOWSKI.
GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS NORM LEWANDOWSKI.
A
CONCERNED RESIDENT OF DUBLIN. I'M
HERE ALSO TO SPEAK ABOUT
THE DUBLIN EXTENSION ROAD. PROJECT.
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ANNEXATION
AND $160 MILLION EXTENSION ROAD WITH
SIX
LANES AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT,
ASK YOURSELVES,
WHAT WOULD THE RESIDENTS HAVE
SAID IF YOU WOULD HAVE PUT THIS
ON THE 2024 MEASURE BALLOT?
YOU KNOW THEY WOULD HAVE
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED NO.
THAT'S WHY THE CITY PERFECTLY USED
MISLEADING WORDING THAT SAID MEASURE
II WAS
ABOUT SAVING OPEN SPACE
, LESS TRAFFIC, CLEANER AIR, AND QUICKER EMERGENCY RESPONSE.
THE CITY HAD BEEN
PLANNING ON THIS ROAD SINCE 2014 ,
AND HAS ALREADY SPENT MILLIONS
BEFORE MEASURE II
WAS EVEN ON THE BALLOT. SELLING
THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN, WAS
A WAY FOR THE CITY TO TAKE CONTROL
AWAY FROM THE RESIDENCE
ON THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.
BY THE WAY,
WHY DOESN'T THE CITY SHOW THE PLANNED COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT ON THE PICTURES OF THE
ROADWAYS THAT'S ON DUBLIN'S
WOODSIDE FOR THIS PROJECT?
YOU KNOW WHAT RESIDENTS WOULD
SAY IF THEY SAW THIS OCCUR IN OPEN SPACE.
I ASKED THE CONSUL TO REALIZE
THAT YOU
HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO DO WAS IN THE
BEST INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS, NOT
WAS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF DEVELOPERS FOR PROPERTY OWNERS.
SPENDING $160 MILLION BASED ON
WISHFUL FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS
FOR AN EXORBITANT ROAD THAT BENEFITS
ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF
DUBLIN'S POPULATION MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY
NO SENSE TO ME.
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CITY'S LATEST
FINANCIAL DATA SHOWS THAT
DUBLIN'S RESERVES WILL BE DEPLETED IN 2031.
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE CITY'S CURRENT
EXTRAVAGANT EXTENSION ROAD PROJECT
CUTTING THROUGH OPEN SPACE IS NOT WHAT RESIDENTS WANT.
THINK ABOUT
THIS WHEN ASKED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT.
I WANTED TO ADD,
WE HAVE QUITE A FEW RESIDENTS TRYING
TO CONTACT THE
COUNCIL ON THEIR WEBSITE. I'VE
NAVIGATED THE WEBSITE MYSELF,
AND IT'S NOT EASY. BEFORE, THERE USED
TO BE A CONTACT , IT USED TO BE
COUNCIL@DUBLIN.CA.GOV,
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT WORKING ANYMORE.
FOR RESIDENTS TO CONTACT THE
COUNCIL, I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT WEBSITE, SEE IF
YOU CAN REACTIVATE THAT. OR MAKE IT MORE
EASILY TO FIND HOW TO
SEND IN SOME SORT OF RESPONSE. THANK YOU.
THANK
YOU. WE'LL TAKE THE COMMENT.
MAYOR, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS TODD BENSON.
GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL, MY
NAME IS TODD BENSON, 12
YEAR RESIDENT OF DUBLIN. WHAT I'M
HERE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE
DUBLIN TO LIVERMORE EXTENSION. AND
AGREE WITH ALL THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE
HEARD SO FAR, AND THE MAP,
WHICH WAS VERY HELPFUL. THE COST
OF THE ROAD EXTENSION,
WHAT I'VE HEARD AND CONFIRMED,
IT'S ROUGHLY ONE 60 MILLION NOW, BUT
IT PROBABLY WON'T GET STARTED
FOR A COUPLE YEARS. SO THEN
WHAT WILL THE COST REALLY BE AND WHO'S
GOING TO PAY FOR IT. ONE
ALSO HAS ME CONCERNED IS JUST ONE
OF THE THREE MAJOR
PROJECTS DUBLIN HAS PLANNED.
ONE OF THEM BEING THE FUTURE DUBLIN DOWNTOWN,
THE OTHER BEING
THE DUBLIN SPORTS ARENA, WHICH SOUNDS GREAT, BUT
THESE TWO, I'M
SURE THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN THE ROAD EXTENSION, AND WHO'S
GOING TO BE PAYING
FOR ALL OF THIS? AND WHO BENEFITS
FOR THIS? I'M CONCERNED,
AS THEY WERE MENTIONING,
THAT DUBLIN WILL RUN OUT OF MONEY.
THESE AREN'T CHEAP, AND WHO IS BENEFITING FROM
IT BESIDES THE DEVELOPERS? I'M JUST
VERY CONCERNED AT THE END OF THE DAY, OR THE YEARS,
WE'RE GOING TO END UP HOLDING MOST
OF THE BILL, AND THE
DEVELOPERS WILL JUST MAKE THEIR MONEY AND GO.
THESE ARE THE KIND OF PROJECTS THAT
WORRY ME AND OTHER RESIDENTS, BECAUSE WE
DON'T WANT TO GET STUCK WITH A BILL.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST DEVELOPMENT, SMART
DEVELOPMENT, WE'RE NOT AGAINST
IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR CITY. BUT WE ARE
AGAINST PAYING FOR THINGS
THAT AREN'T
WELL BUDGETED FOR, AND IS GOING TO
COST ALL OF US
A LOT OF MONEY. AS WE
KNOW RIGHT NOW, THE STATE AND FEDERAL
GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO COME TO
OUR RESCUE, ESPECIALLY NOW. GETTING
BACK TO THE ROAD EXTENSION, I
HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL LOOK AND CONSIDER
THIS VERY GOOD PLAN THAT'S BEEN
PRESENTED TO THEM. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT
UNDER $50 MILLION COMPARED TO $160
MILLION
FOR A ROAD EXTENSION JUST EXTENDING
EXISTING ROADS
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE
, IN MY UNDERSTANDING IT WOULD BE A
THIRD
OF A MILE TO CONNECT THE TWO, SOUNDS
BRILLIANT. I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THAT. PLEASE. AND
I'M URGING OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY, I'M NOT
ONLY ACTIVE WITHIN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,
BUT OTHER LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS.
AND I'M
EXPLAINING ALL OF THIS TO THEM, I'M TALKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH THIS IS COSTING
US AND THAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS NOT REALLY
DOING THEIR JOB IN LOOKING OUT
FOR US. I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING OUT
MORE FOR THE GREEDY DEVELOPERS AND THE LANDOWNERS
WHO ARE THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF
ALL THIS.
SO I'M URGING THEM
, AS WAS ALSO SPOKEN, TO
PLEASE WRITE AND CALL THE CITY COUNCIL, WITH
THEIR CONCERNS OF THIS
OVERSPENDING THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE,
AND MAY RUN OUT BECAUSE
WE DON'T END UP LIKE PLEASANTON, WHO
DOES HAVE A DEFICIT AND THEY'RE
SHUTTING DOWN THEIR LIBRARY HOURS.
SO PLEASE, CONSIDER THIS IDEA, BECAUSE
DUBLIN RESIDENTS ARE WATCHING, AND WE WILL BE
VOTING FOR OUR OWN NEEDS AND GOALS FOR
THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.
MAYOR, THE LAST SPEAKER IS
TONY RODOLFO BENSON.
GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL. MY NAME
IS SONIA RODOLFO BENSON.
I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF EAST BAY
FOR 30 YEARS, DUBLIN RESIDENT FOR OVER 12 YEARS,
AND I WOULD
LIKE TO DISCUSS HOW THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS
TO BE MORE HONEST WITH DUBLIN.
ABOUT THE PLANS AND DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE
APPROVING AND WHAT THE
COST WILL BE, WE TALKED ABOUT HOW
THIS PROJECT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S
GOING TO BE PARALLEL 580 IS GOING TO COST
160 MILLION AT THIS TIME.
THE ONE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS LESS THAN THAT.
I'VE BEEN COMMUTING
TO SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO FOR MANY YEARS.
I TRAVEL ALONG
BONNERS ROAD WHICH
IS ONLY A TWO WAY ROAD, AND THAT WORKS
OUT JUST GREAT, ALONG
580. I'VE ALSO TRAVELED
ON BLACK HAWK, GOING TO BLACK
HAWK, AND THIS IS A SIX LANE
ROAD, REALLY WIDE ROAD, AND THERE'S
HARDLY ANYBODY THERE, AND I TRAVEL THAT TO TEACH.
THINK ABOUT IT . $160 MILLION
OF ROAD
THAT IS PROBABLY
NOT GOING TO BE USED,
VERSUS A FRACTION OF THAT THAT'S GOING
BE JUST AS FUNCTIONAL, AND WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY, I THINK IT
JUST MAKES MORE SENSE.
AS A RESIDENT OF DUBLIN, I'M REALLY
CONCERNED ABOUT
HOW WE'RE SPENDING MONEY, BECAUSE
I PLAN TO LIVE HERE FOR MANY YEARS
, AND IF WE'RE GOING TO LOSE MONEY
AND WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY OUR BILLS,
WE NEED TO PICK ABOUT THAT. I THINK
SAFETY ON THE ROADS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.
TRAVERSE STAGECOACH ROAD ALL THE TIME, AND THE PEOPLE
THAT STRIVING THAT ROAD HAS BEEN SPEEDING
ALL THE TIME, NOT
STOPPING, MAYBE A SPEEDBUMP THERE WOULD BE
SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE
, SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT, SAFETY OF THE ROADS RATHER
THAN SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY ON A ROAD THAT'S
PROBABLY GOING TO BE NOT AS USED.
AGAIN, I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THANK YOU.
MAYOR, I'D LIKE TO GET CLARIFICATION. AS
FAR AS WE KNOW,
THE EMAIL COUNCIL AT --IS
WORKING, IF ANYONE HAS
ANY
TROUBLE WITH IT, I'M HAPPY TO HELP, YOU
CAN FIND MY EMAIL ADDRESS UNDER THE
CITY MANAGER'S APARTMENT AND EMAIL
ME AND I'LL WORK OUT ANY COMMUNICATION ISSUES.
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS?
I HAVE NO OTHER SPEAKER SLIPS, MAYOR.
AT THIS MOMENT, WE'LL RECESS
OUR REGULAR MEETING AND GO
TO THE GAD MEETING, WE'LL CALL
THAT MEETING TO
ORDER AT 7:50 P.M. AND THEN, FOR
THE GAD MEETING, WE ALSO
WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC
COMMENTS.
I HAVE NO PUBLIC COMMENT, MAYOR.
NO PUBLIC
COMMENTS ON THE G.A.D. MEETING, SO WE'LL GO
FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR OF
THE G.A.D. MEETING.
SO, FOR CONSENT CALENDAR,
I WANT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSENT CALENDAR?
IN G.A.D. MEETING. WE HAVE
I'M
HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
OKAY, GO AHEAD, COUNCILMEMBER.
STILL TRYING TO SHIFT BETWEEN THE
TWO. BUT, ON THE
ITEM 3.2 ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR,
NOT TO
EXCEED AMOUNT IS $1 MILLION FOR EACH OF
--
WHICH I BEEN? ON THE 3.2 ON
G.H.A.D... THE NGO CONTRACT.
THE NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT IS $1 MILLION FOR
THREE YEARS
FROM EACH OF THOSE FOR EACH OF THOSE CONTRACTS
IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO ME AS IF WE'VE
EVER COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO
$1 MILLION FOR G.H.A.D. SERVICES,
IN ANY OF THE THREE, CAN WE TALK A
LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHY THAT NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT
IS SET THE WAY IT IS?
SORRY.
GOOD EVENING.
PRESIDENT, AND BOARD MEMBERS, THE
G.H.A.D. ENGINEER, THAT ITEM TONIGHT
IS TO AWARD THREE SEPARATE
CONTRACTS FOR ON-CALL SERVICES
TO NGO FOR EACH OF THE THREE GUARDS
IN DUBLIN, THAT
IS CORRECT, FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM
WITH A NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT OF $1 MILLION.
YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IN THE
PAST, LOOKING AT THE LAST CONTRACT
TO BE HELD WITH
OUR G.H.A.D. SERVICE CONSULTING, WE HAVE
NOT REACHED THAT
AMOUNT IN THE THREE OR FIVE YEAR TERM,
WE CHOSE A LARGER AMOUNT TO
AVOID HAVING TO POTENTIALLY COME BACK
TO THE BOARD
FOR AN AMENDMENT, WHICH MAY SOMETIMES
DELAY OUR DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES.
IT IS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER BUT A NUMBER
THAT WE THOUGHT WAS
REASONABLE GIVEN OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTS WE HAD
AS AN EXAMPLE ON THE CITY SIDE FOR ON-CALL SERVICES.
THERE'S A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONTRACTS IN HERE,
THE NGO CONTRACT IS FOR CONSULTING,
BUT THEY DON'T DO THE ACTUAL
GRADING OR HILL SLIDE WORK IF THERE
WAS ANOTHER FLOOD AND THERE WAS A SLIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE.
IT'S THE CONSULTING
SERVICES FOR THAT WORK, CORRECT?
THANKS FOR ASKING
THAT, IT'S FOR A PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES, IT INCLUDES
GEOLOGISTS, CIVIL
ENGINEERING, THEY ALSO PROVIDE THE GIS SERVICES
, THEY ARE ALSO
OUR ON-CALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE MEETING THE
FIRST ONES ON
THE GROUND WHEN WE GET A CALL FOR
ANY ISSUES OUT THERE.
IT'S FOR DAY-TO-DAY SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDES
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS G.H.A.D. STAFF.
IT IS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, NOT
CONTRACT SERVICES, BUT CONTRACTOR SERVICES.
EVEN IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDED
THE TWO FLOOD YEARS, WE
DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO $1 MILLION.
NOT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, YOU'RE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS
IS HIGHER
THAN HIS REALLY NECESSARY. THE CONTRACT AS WRITTEN,
THE BUDGET
, IT LOOKS LIKE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT
IS UNDER $600,000 BUDGETED.
FOR THE THREE-YEAR TERM, IS THAT RIGHT FOR
THE G.H.A.D. WITH
THE MOST EXTENSIVE CONSULTING SERVICES ?
FOR EVERY YEAR WE COME TO THE BOARD, WE
BRING A PROPOSED BUDGET
FOR THAT FISCAL YEAR,
SO IN EVERY YEAR YOU ARE CORRECT,
WE ARE NOT COMING
IN HERE THAT, IF WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY
A FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT,
THERE IS A POTENTIAL ,
I WOULD AGREE, NOT LIKELY, BUT A POTENTIALLY
COULD EXCEED THAT AMOUNT THAT
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST.
THESE ARE
THREE-YEAR CONTRACTS.
CURRENTLY THREE-YEAR CONTRACTS, IN THE PAST
I WOULD SAY EXCELLENT SERVICES, WE
REQUEST THE BOARD TO
EXTEND THAT FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS.
WE HAVE IN THE PAST GONE TO A FIVE-YEAR
MAXIMUM.
AT THAT POINT WE CANNOT ONLY EXTEND THE
TERM BUT EXTEND THE NOT TO EXCEED,
CORRECT?
THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY, THANK
YOU. I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
IF
WE DID NOT HAVE A ONE MILLION-DOLLAR
NOT TO EXCEED AMOUNT ON THESE.
ON TWO OF
THEM, 500,000 WOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
AND ON THE THIRD
600,000 WOULD STILL GET US THERE,
IF MY MATH IS CORRECT.
THAT GIVE STAFF COMPLETE HEARTBURN? THAT AMOUNT?
NO, STAFF CAN ALWAYS RETURN TO
THE BOARD TO AMEND IT IF
WE NEED TO EXCEED OR INCREASE THE
AMOUNT TO EXCEED.
OKAY.
THAT WOULD
BE MY PREFERENCE BUT THAT'S JUST MY
PREFERENCE, I DON'T KNOW HOW THE REST
OF THE BOARD FEELS.
WE HAVE BEEN
USING THIS 1 MILLION IN
THE CONTRACT FOR MANY YEARS, OR IT'S NEW?
OUT BE
HONEST, I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER IN FRONT
OF ME. I WAS A LOOKING
AT HOW MUCH OUR EXPENDITURES HAVE
BEEN THEY'VE NEVER BEEN A $1 MILLION. I
DON'T
RECALL WHAT OUR LAST FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT
NOT TO EXCEED WAS, IT OBVIOUSLY, WE
PAY FOR
THE ACTUAL SERVICES EXPENDED AND INVOICED.
I SEE THERE'S
ADDITIONAL COST IF WE WANT TO MAKE
THE CHANGE. AND MAYBE DEPENDS IF THAT'S
CRITICAL, WITH THAT MAKE ANY
BIGGER SAVINGS?
SEEMS LIKE,
YOU KNOW, IF WE REDUCE OUR LIMIT WITH
THAT END UP WITH MORE WORK EFFICIENCY, BETTER SAVINGS
, NOT THAT
WAY? THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
YEAH. IT'S JUST
A NOT TO EXCEED.
WE HAVEN'T COLLECTED IT, THAT LEVEL.
WE HAVEN'T.
I'M NOT SURE, I AGREE WITH YOU AND I
LIKE HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT
THE DIFFERENT LEVELS AND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE.
TO ME,
THIS IS JUST A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS IT
TO GO UP TO THERE. IT'S
NOT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY
COLLECTING THAT. IF IT'S THE WILL
OF EVERYBODY ELSE I'M FINE TO
MAKE THAT ADMINISTERED OF CHANGE IF THERE'S
A COST OF MAKING THE ADMINISTRATIVE
CHANGE, THIS IS NOT THAT CRITICAL, BUT, THE AWARENESS
, IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT YOU'VE MADE.
IF IT COSTS MONEY TO MAKE THAT CHANGE, I'M NOT SURE
IT'S
VALUE, IN MY HEAD.
DOES IT COST MONEY
TO MAKE THAT CHANGE?
VERY EASY TO MAKE THE CHANGE.
VERY EASY?
I THINK IT'S
JUST AN ADMINISTERED OF THING, IF
YOU KEEP IT EVEN AT THREE QUARTERS
OF 1 MILLION
FOR ALL THREE, THEN, IT DOESN'T
, IN MY OPINION IT DOESN'T ADD ANY REAL
VALUE IN
TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY OR ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT,
IF IT HELPS
YOU, THEN, THAT'S FINE.
ALSO VALUE THAT POINT. IT'S JUST, IT IS
A THRESHOLD.
IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE
THRESHOLD. THAT'S ALL THAT IS. SO,
YEAH, IF THAT'S EASY, I'M GOOD.
IN THAT CASE, I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION
FOR THE ENTIRE CONSENT CALENDAR WITH
THE CAVEAT THAT WE HAVE THE NOT TO EXCEED
AMOUNT ON ALL THREE CONTRACTS BE
THREE QUARTERS OF 1 MILLION.
ALL IN FAVOR, SAY AYE. AYE.
THANK YOU, THE MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.
SO, LET'S SEE.
WE'LL ADJOURN THAT MEETING AND RECONVENE
THE REGULAR CITY COUNCIL MEETING NOW.
LET'S GO BACK TO CITY COUNCIL.
SO, NOW WE ARE IN CITY COUNCIL MEETING AGENDA
NUMBER FIVE, CONSENT CALENDAR.
SO, CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS ARE TYPICALLY
NONCONTROVERSIAL
IN NATURE, AND ARE CONSIDERED FOR APPROVAL
BY THE CITY COUNCIL
WITH ONE SINGLE ACTION.
SO
I WANT TO ASK COUNCILMEMBERS, ANY
QUESTIONS?
I HAVE SEVERAL ITEMS, I
HAVE A QUESTION ON 5.2, I HAVE A POTENTIAL
SEPARATE MOTION ON 5.5,
AND ON 5.7.
ANY FROM YOU?
QUESTIONS
ON 5.8, AND 5.10.
5.8, 5.10.
SHOULD WE
PASS THE REST OF THEM FIRST, AND THEN
GO OVER EACH OF THEM?
MAKE A MOTION FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR, EXCLUDING
ITEMS 5.2, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 5.10.
SECOND. SO WE HAVE FIRST AND SECOND,
ALL IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
AYE. THESE
AGENDA ITEMS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY,
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE QUESTIONS, 5.2,
COUNCILMEMBER JOSEY?
ITEM 5.2 IS
A MASTERPIECE SCHEDULE, WHICH
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
THE SUMMER VACATION OF IT WITH THE
RESIDENCE
FEES, AND THE NONRESIDENT, FOR
EVERY ITEM, THERE WAS A COUPLE COMMENTS
I WANTED TO MAKE.
ONE, THE BLANKET STATEMENT THAT WE HAVE
, THAT THE NONRESIDENT RATE
FOR PARK FEES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS 20% HIGHER
. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US CALL MORE
ATTENTION TO THAT
IN THE SCHEDULE, BOLD IT
OR SOMEHOW MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE OBVIOUS
SO THAT NOBODY GETS
SHOCKED. I DON'T KNOW THAT A TON OF PEOPLE LOOK AT
THIS,
MOSTLY PEOPLE JUST GO
THROUGH THEIR CART ON THE WEBSITE,
BUT I STILL DON'T WANT SURPRISES
FOR RESIDENTS OR NONRESIDENTS WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING
AT OUR FEE STRUCTURE AND THEN THEY
GO TO
CHECK OUT AND THEY'RE LIKE WAIT A
MINUTE, I THOUGHT IT WAS THIS RATE,
SO THAT WOULD BE ONE COMMENT I WOULD
HAVE, AND MY SECOND COMMENT IS ON
THE WAVE, HAVE WE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING
SENIOR RATE FOR THE WAVE?
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF MULTIGENERATIONAL
FAMILIES IN
DUBLIN, AND WE HAVE A
LOT OF GRANDPARENTS TO STAY HOME WITH
THE KIDS IN THE SUMMER, AND I
WOULD LOVE TO SEE US, IF IT'S
THE WILL OF COUNCIL IF WE COULD INVESTIGATE
HAVING A SENIOR RATE FOR BOTH THE
WAVE AND ALSO LAP SWIMMING. WHATEVER
AGE THAT MIGHT BE,
I WANTED TO HEAR IF
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE.
SOMETHING ALONG THE SAME LINES AS
PERHAPS THE VETERAN RATE
TO HAVE A SENIOR RATE AS WELL.
ANYTHING IS FEASIBLE, THAT'S YOUR GUYS'S PREROGATIVE.
COULD I ADD SENIORS AND DISABLED?
SURE.
MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMBERS, I THINK
WE HAD
INVESTIGATED A FEE RELATED TO THE DISABLED CATEGORY.
FEEL LIKE I RECALL THAT WE HAD SOME CHALLENGES
IN DEFINING
WHAT THAT IS. SO WE'LL GO BACK AND
DO THAT WORK AGAIN, I JUST
WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS BEFORE AND I RECALL
HAVING SOME CHALLENGES RELATED TO,
HOW
DO YOU DEFINE THAT? BUT,
WE WILL WORK ON THAT,
THE SENIOR ONE CLEARLY IS EASY.
AN ARBITRARY AGE, WHATEVER SOCIAL
SECURITY RETIREMENT IS, IF
WE DECIDE TO CALL IT 65,
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF WE CAN
FIGURE OUT A
WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
55? MAYBE NOT
, MAYBE SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE BIT
HIGHER
THAN THAT, I THINK. THAT WOULD BE
GREAT WHATEVER STANDARD FOR THE
AREA, WHATEVER THE PARK SERVICES CALL SENIOR RATE.
MIGHT BE INSTEAD OF US TRYING TO MAKE A
DETERMINATION BASED ON
HOW OLD WE ARE.
WE CAN KEEP IT
SIMPLE, SENIOR AND YOUTH CAN BE THE SAME RATE.
JUST A RANDOM
RECOMMENDATION.
THE YOUTH IS BY HEIGHT,
WE HAVE,
IN THE WAVE, WE
HAVE THE LITTLE KIDS, BECAUSE OF THE
SLIDES
AND ALL THAT, IT'S BY HEIGHT. I WOULD
LEAVE
IT UP TO PARK STAFF. TO MAKE THE AGES.
BUT THAT'S
FOR NEXT TIME.
WE CAN UPDATE IT AT ANY TIME.
WE CAN
IMPLEMENT A SENIOR RATE. AS SOON AS
I TALK
TO THE WAVE STAFF, WE CAN GET SOMETHING PUT IN IMMEDIATELY.
THERE WILL BE SOME STIPULATIONS AROUND IT,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INVESTIGATE
WHETHER OR NOT, WITH THE VETERAN RATE
IT'S SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO PURCHASE
IN
PERSON, BECAUSE IT'S HOW ACTIVE NET IS SET UP,
I ASSUME
SENIORS WOULD BE SOMETHING RELATIVELY
THE SAME, THEY WOULD NEED TO DO IT ON SITE.
WE WOULD DO THE SAME
THING FOR HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS. SO THAT
ANYTHING THAT'S OFF OF THE NORMAL
FULL PRICE, YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO ON
PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE CERTIFYING
YOU ARE, IN FACT, THAT AGE FOR THAT HEIGHT.
IN ORDER TO GET THE
DISCOUNT.
WE CAN GET IT STARTED
.
BE FINE WITH ME.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT, SINCE WE'RE ROLLING
INTO A SUMMER SEASON.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS ON THAT ITEM.
AT 5.2. 5.5?
THAT'S ME AGAIN.
I THINK IT'S THE VERY ,
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. NOW I NEED TO
FIND IN MY
NOTES WEBPAGE THAT'S ON.
PAGE 122 IS PROBABLY, OR PAGE 92,
IS THE BEST WAY TO GO.
I DON'T FEEL THAT THIS PARTICULAR ONE,
I LOVE ALL
THE REST OF THEM, THIS PARTICULAR BOX 9,
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT, SO MUCH
AS IT IS
ABOUT, A TOXIC CLOUD. I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S
THE COLORS, OR WHAT, IT
DIDN'T FIT THE THEME OF WHAT WE WERE GOING FOR,
BUT, TO ME, IT EVOKES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE,
I WANTED TO PULL THAT TO SEE WHAT
THE REST OF
YOU THOUGHT OF IT, AND SEE
THIS IS NOT ONE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO
SEE ON A
UTILITY BOX IN DUBLIN,
PROMOTING THE THEME OF NATURE IN THE
URBAN ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IT
DOESN'T EVOKE NATURE TO ME, IT EVOKES
TOXIC FUMES AND TRYING TO AVOID THEM.
JUST A MEETING BUT I WANTED TO POINTED
OUT TO THE
REST OF YOU.
TO BE HONEST, THIS
ONE SORT OF
CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD AS WELL, BUT
I READ THE ARTIST STATEMENT, AND FELT
BETTER ABOUT IT. IT
REMINDS YOU OF THE WALL THE
TYPE STORY LINE WHERE, IF WE DON'T START PROTECTING OUR
ENVIRONMENT, HERE'S THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO.
I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEVER
AND I LIKE IT, BUT AGAIN, THE ART IS
VERY, VERY OBJECTIVE.
OR SUBJECTIVE, RATHER.
I LIKED
WHAT THE ARTIST HAD TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU
DRIVE BY, GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ WITH
THE ARTIST HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT, I
THINK THAT SHE OR HE, THE
ARTIST WAS GOING FOR THE BEAUTY IS
OVERTAKING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT,
LIFE WILL OUT SORT OF THING.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE
IMAGE EVOKES TO ME. SO
I JUST WANTED TO, I THINK THAT I'LL
BE VOTING
AGAINST THIS PARTICULAR ONE. AND SO
IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME, I'D LIKE TO
MAKE THE MOTION WHEN WE
GET THERE. BUT IF THE REST OF YOU
LOVE IT I'M HAPPY TO BE VOTED DOWN.
I DID A LOOK
AT EACH OF THEM, I LOVE A LOT OF THEM.
I REALLY LOVE THEM.
AND EVEN THIS ONE,
I KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHY YOU FEEL THAT WAY,
I THOUGHT, IT'S OKAY. THAT'S
HOW I FEEL, IT'S GREAT, I UNDERSTAND
MORE ABOUT IT, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
MAYBE MAKE SOME CHANGE TO THE COLOR TO MAKE IT
MORE LIGHTHEARTED SOMEHOW.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL. BUT I'M GOOD.
MIKE, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL. IT'S DIFFERENT
THAN THE OTHER
ONES, AND IN MY MIND, EACH
ONE OF THESE HAS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE.
AND A DIFFERENT ANGLE FOR THE MESSAGE,
AND I SEE IT AS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN THE
OTHER ONES, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN EVERYTHING
ELSE IS THE SAME.
SO, I PERSONALLY DON'T
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. I THOUGHT
THE ARTIST DID A REALLY GOOD JOB. IT'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S INTERESTING. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LOOK
AT IT AND GO, IT'S A
UTILITY BOX. NO, THEY'RE GOING TO SAY,
THAT'S A REALLY COOL THING, THEY'LL
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON.
I THINK THE ART ITSELF
IS VERY COOL, BEING PART OF THIS PANEL OF,
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE
MAKE A MOTION.
WE GO THROUGH EVERYTHING AND
THEN WE CAN VOTE.
AND THEN
5.7 IS, THE AGREEMENT
FOR THE ADDITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES,
IT'S GOT THE AUTOMATIC. YOU AGAIN,
PULLED ALL YOUR ITEMS. THE AGREEMENT
WITH THE SERVICES
HAS AN AUTOMATIC 5% ESCALATOR
. WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR ADDITIONAL HOURS?
ARE WE
JUST PAYING FOR STAFF?
I CAN TRY TO GET
YOU MY BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF IT AND
THE LIBRARY WAS GENEROUS ENOUGH
TO SEND STAFF HERE TO ANSWER MORE SPECIFIC BUDGETARY QUESTIONS
IF I CAN'T COVER EVERYTHING.
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOES
COVER STAFF, IT ALSO COVERS AN INCREASE IN
INSURANCE PREMIUMS AS WELL AS INCREASE IN UTILITY COSTS.
BECAUSE IT IS A PASS-THROUGH, SO
WE PAID UTILITY COST UP-FRONT FOR THAT
BUILDING AND WE CHARGE THEM BACK FOR
THEIR
PORTION OF IT THAT THEY ACTUALLY USE.
UTILITY COSTS DO GO UP FOR THEM. THEY
DON'T HAVE A STANDARD,
IT'S FOR SOME OF THEIR EMPLOYEE RAISES,
IT'S ABOUT THE CPI BECAUSE OF THE
WAY THEIR UNIONS NEGOTIATE
SALARY INCREASES. IF YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS,
DARSHAN IS HERE TO HOPEFULLY BE
ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE FOR YOU.
YOU THREW ME A LITTLE BIT, I GET THE
INSURANCE.
WE PAID THE INSURANCE OR THEY PAY
THE INSURANCE?
WE MEAN WORKER'S COMPENSATION.
OKAY. AND
SO, THEY PAY THAT AND
WE ARE PAYING THAT FOR THOSE HOURS.
THAT'S CORRECT.
AND THAT GOES UP, DO WE KNOW
, THAT'S AN INCREMENTAL EVERY YEAR,
DO WE
KNOW THE PERCENTAGE THAT THAT IS ,
WE DON'T
REALLY KNOW THAT YET. AND
THE UTILITIES, YOU THREW ME BECAUSE WE PAY
ON THAT BUILDING AND WE CHARGE THEM BACK
FOR ALL OF
THE HOURS THAT THEY'RE USING IT OR
ONLY THE HOURS THAT ARE
PART OF THE ORIGINAL , IS IT 28? 23?
AGAIN,
I'M NOT SURE OF THE BREAKDOWN. I KNOW
THAT WE PAY FOR IT UP-FRONT AND
WE GET CHARGED BACK A CERTAIN AMOUNT, BUT
PERHAPS YOU KNOW A BETTER ANSWER
FOR THAT.
BASICALLY, THIS CONTRACT
COVERS STAFF COST, AND
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
IN THE 5% INCREASE, SO BASICALLY ,
IT IS MORE THAN 5%.
COST OF MATERIALS IS
GOING UP, WE ARE
BUYING A LOT OF MATERIAL THAT
PEOPLE ARE USING ONLINE MATERIALS,
SO THAT IS GETTING EXPENSIVE.
SHOWED US WHAT HAS GONE UP, MAYBE 10%,
UTILITIES ARE GOING UP,
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IS MORE THAN 5%,
BUT THAT IS
AGREEMENT WE AGREED THAT
WE WILL NOT INCREASE MORE THAN 5%.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WITH OTHER CITIES.
THE MATERIALS
AND STUFF, THOUGH, THOSE ARE FIXED COST, YES?
IF WE DIDN'T INCREASE THE HOURS, THOSE COSTS
WOULD STILL
BE BORNE BY ALAMEDA COUNTY.
YES,
THE HOURS
INCREASE IS BASICALLY KEEPING OPEN,
AND ALL THAT, BUT, WHEN WE DO THAT
OVERHEAD EXPENSES.
MATERIAL COST
AND OTHER COSTS COMING TO THAT OVERHEAD AS WELL. SO,
OVERALL COST OF DOING BUSINESS.
SO, I
CAN GET THE DETAIL LIKE THAT,
IS FUNDED BY THREE DIFFERENT SOURCES.
NUMBER
ONE IS PROPERTY TAX. PROPERTY TAX,
WE GET ABOUT
1% OF TOTAL PROPERTY TAX COLLECTED.
HAVE THAT PROPERTY TAX.
DUBLIN HAS AN ASSESSED VALUE
OF OVER 3.4 BILLION. WHERE IS OVERALL
AREA HAS AN ASSESSED
VALUE OF 159 BILLION. ABOUT
50% OF THE TOTAL PROPERTY TAXES
5.5 MILLION. AND
THE SEVEN OF THIS CONTRACT, 700,000, THAT FUNDS 23.
TO FUND EVEN,
WE USED TO KEEP FRIDAY OPEN.
SO THE CITY COMES BACK TO SAY,
WE'RE GOING
TO ADD MORE OF, THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS,
[
INAUDIBLE ] OVER THERE, AND THE COST
OF KEEPING ONE OPEN
IS ABOUT 30,000 ANNUALLY. SO,
AND OTHER UTILITIES,
IF WE KEEP IT
MORE OPEN, WE USE MORE UTILITY,
THAT IS HOW IT IS CALCULATED.
AND THEN THE THIRD PART IS LIKE,
WE CONTRIBUTE THE 500,000,
THAT IS THE BUDGET,
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT BUDGET.
AND 51 HOURS, THAT'S
THE MOST OPEN HOURS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.
[ INAUDIBLE
]
I UNDERSTAND.
MY QUESTIONS ARE, THERE ARE FIXED
COSTS AND THEIR HOURLY COST.
IF THE CITY OF DUBLIN DECIDED WE HAD
A BUDGET CRISIS TOMORROW AND ONE
OF THE THINGS WE HAD TO CUT FOR THE LIBRARY HOURS,
THE CITIZENS OF DUBLIN, RESIDENTS OF
DUBLIN WOULD BE ABLE
TO GET THEIR BOOKS ONLINE. THEY
WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE WHOLE COLLECTION ONLINE, CORRECT?
ALL OF THE MATERIALS.
THE BOOKS
WOULD STILL BE THERE FOR THE NUMBER OF
HOURS THAT THE LIBRARY WAS OPEN THAT
THE COUNTY PAYS FOR, CORRECT? THAT COST WOULDN'T CHANGE.
WE WOULD STILL BE
PAYING THE UTILITIES ON THAT BUILDING
ALL THE TIME, UTILITY COSTS WOULD
GO DOWN,
IF THERE'S NOBODY IN THEIR THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ON,
AND WE WOULD STILL BE PASSING ON A LOWER COST
TO THE COUNTY FOR THE HOURS THE COUNTY
WAS IN THERE, RIGHT?
THE COST THAT WE
WOULD NO LONGER BE PAYING FOR WOULD
BE FOR THE
PERSONNEL TO STAFF IT WHILE IN THE EXTRA
HOURS THAT WE WERE THERE,
AND THE WORKERS COMP FOR THOSE HOURS
WHILE THEY WERE WORKING, AND
THE UTILITIES DURING THOSE HOURS.
BUT WE
SHOULDN'T BE, IN MY OPINION, WE SHOULD
NOT BE PAYING, WE
SHOULD BE PICKING UP A , WE SHOULD
BE
DIVIDING THE COST OF THE COLLECTION
BY THE 23 HOURS YOU PAY FOR, THE 28
HOURS WE PAY FOR, VICE VERSA, THAT
WAS FIXED COSTS THAT THE COUNTY WOULD BE PAYING ANYWAY.
THAT SHOULDN'T BE PART OF THE HOURLY CALCULATION.
ONLY PAYING
$700,000 OUT OF THE $6 MILLION BUDGET.
CITY COMES BACK TO THE LIBRARY
TO KEEP THAT OPEN FOR MORE OFFERS,
I UNDERSTAND THAT. SO BASICALLY,
FOR THE 28 HOURS THAT WE KEEP OPEN,
THE $5 MILLION EXPENSE,
IS NOT DIRECTLY THE SAME
AS ALL THE MATERIALS,
LIKE
I.T. COST.
MY QUESTION, MY ORIGINAL QUESTION IS
WHAT IS IN WHAT WE PAY
FOR, AND WHY IS IT GOING UP BY 5%
INSTEAD
OF BY COLA, BASICALLY?
MOST OF THE STAFF COST IS UTILITIES.
THAT STAFF
IS MORE THAN 5%.
SOME OF THEM ARE 7% INCREASES.
SO, THAT'S THE COST.
WE DO THAT WITH
EVERY CITY, 5%, WE DO 5% INCREASE.
I GUESS I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE
TO SEE
THOSE BREAKDOWNS. THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.
I HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS AS WELL,
I WANT TO BE MORE FUNDAMENTAL ON THIS. THE QUESTION WAS
, IT'S VERY BASIC, WHY ARE WE SEEING
AN INCREASE IN COST, AND WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING IT, AND
COUNCILMEMBER WENT IN TO FIX THE VARIABLE STRUCTURES.
WHAT I'M MORE INTERESTED IN IS,
THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION THAT CAN
BE QUICKLY ANSWERED, ARE
YOU PROVIDING ALL THE DETAIL TO THE CITY
THE BREAKDOWN OF THESE
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS?
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING
IT? IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. DO YOU
PROVIDE THE CITY
WITH A DETAILED BREAKDOWN, OF THE WHOLE THING.
WRITE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF
THERE IS ANY OTHER INFORMATION
, WE CAN PROVIDE THAT.
IT WAS A BASIC QUESTION, DO
YOU PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION
FOR THE CITY TO EVALUATE THE DETAIL,
OR,
DO PROVIDE. WE DO PROVIDE WHATEVER
WE ARE ASKED FOR.
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WE HAVE
BEEN
GOING ON THE EMAIL, PROVIDED.
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED. SO,
THAT'S
BASICALLY, WHATEVER QUESTIONS
YOU
HAVE, WE HAVE THE INFORMATION, WE
CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAIL. THIS
CAN BE, LIKE WHEN
WE DO THE BUSINESS,
LIKE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO CLOSE THE LIBRARY
AT 5:00, TO KEEP IT OPEN TO
8:00, THREE HOURS, WE NEED STAFF
FOR THAT THREE HOURS, WE NEED
UTILITIES FOR THREE HOURS, AND THE
STAFF COST IS GOING UP.
SO WE ASKED STEADY TO
INCREASE 5%,
SO I WANT MY QUESTION ANSWERED.
OKAY? I APPRECIATE THAT,
THAT YOU'RE ANSWERING HER QUESTION
THAT I DIDN'T ASK.
MY QUESTION IS, I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GOOD THING TO SIMPLY PROVIDE THE CITY WITH
A FULL DETAIL
OF WHAT
THESE COSTS ARE ABOUT,
SO WE CAN ASSESS WHAT'S DRIVING IT, AND I HAD
AN EASY QUESTION I WAS ABOUT TO LEAD
INTO, SO I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A
LITTLE ABRUPT, BUT I DIDN'T WANTED TO DIGRESS.
WE GO THROUGH THESE EVALUATIONS PERIODICALLY,
I DO SEE THE VALUE OF HAVING FULL SERVICE
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE
IN A SITUATION LIKE SOME OF OUR
CITIES THAT WE KNOW OF, BUT, I AM CURIOUS,
ABOUT,
ON THE BASELINE,
IT'S 28 HOURS.
HOW MANY
VERY FUNDAMENTALLY, GENERALLY SPEAKING, HOW MANY
FTES, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN THAT BASELEVEL?
AND ON THE INCREMENTAL, IS
IT MORE OR LESS THE SAME? IN
TERMS OF, THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT,
THAT WE ARE PAYING
FOR FOR THIS SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION?
YEAH. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
WILL DEPEND ON IF WE'RE OPENING ADDITIONAL
, THREE MORE HOURS, WE WILL NEED
THE SAME THAT WE
DURING REGULAR HOURS.
FOR THESE THREE HOURS, THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL,
ADDITIONAL
STAFF, AND WE CAN EXTEND HOURS FOR THE SAME STAFF.
SO SOME STAFF WILL
CONTINUE MORE HOURS, SOME STAFF WE HAVE
FOR PART-TIME EMPLOYEES.
WE HAVE SERVICE AS NEEDED EMPLOYEES.
WE HAVE TO, LIKE
KEEP THAT OPEN AND
PROVIDE THE STAFF, AND IT DEPENDS ON LIKE
RUSH HOUR MORNING, AFTERNOON,
SO THE PROJECT MANAGER MAKES A DECISION HOW MANY STAFF
SO, IT'S
NOT LIKE, OKAY, BACK THREE YEARS AGO
YOU HAD X
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALLOCATED
FOR THE BASE, AND THE INCREMENTAL.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE, OR
IT DOES, IT ACTUALLY DOES CHANGE?
THESE NUMBERS, HERE, THAT I'M LOOKING AT,
THE ACTUAL FUNDING AMOUNTS,
THE NUMBER OF HOURS,
IT COULD BE DIFFERENT YEAR TO YEAR,
COULD BE GETTING FIVE PEOPLE AT SOME,
FOR
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOURS, OR WE COULD
BE GETTING FOUR OR WHATEVER.
IT'S MOVING AROUND. IS THAT, I'M TRYING
TO GET A FEEL.
YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS AND INSURANCE,
FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES.
THE ACTUAL
EMPLOYEES, SO, I THINK
MAYBE SHE CAN EXPLAIN IT BETTER.
WHEN THE EXTENDED HOURS, HOW MANY
STAFF THEY
ARE USING, AND SO,
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.
AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE, I DON'T WANT
USE UP ALL YOUR GOOD TIME. I JUST
WANT TO GET AN IDEA OF
WHEN WE'RE PRESENTED WITH A BASELINE
OF
28, WHAT'S THE EXPECTATION? AND
WE'RE ADDING 23,
WHAT IS THE EXPECTATION?
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN A
LONG TIME.
I'M THE RANCH MANAGER.
SO, WE ARE OPEN LIKE YOU SAID 51 HOURS
A WEEK, OUR FULL-TIME
IS 18.8. WE HAVE ONLY NINE FULL-TIME STAFF,
AND I
WANT TO SAY 18 PART-TIME STAFF. AND,
BECAUSE STAFF IS SCHEDULED TO WORK
7 1/2 HOURS A DAY, BUT WE'RE OPEN 10
HOURS A DAY, THAT'S WHY WE NEED A LOT
OF PART-TIME STAFF, RIGHT?
AS FAR AS TRAFFIC IS CONCERNED, I
CAN TELL YOU, IT'S NOT FIVE
PEOPLE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE,
WE HAVE ABOUT 100 PEOPLE
IN OUR END OF THE LIBRARY, WE'RE REALLY BUSY.
AND I UNDERSTAND, AS YOU MENTIONED, PEOPLE
CAN USE
MATERIAL AND GET EVERYTHING AT HOME,
NEED MORE THAN THAT.
THEY WANT TO VISIT THEIR LOCAL
LIBRARY, THEY WANT TO ATTEND PROGRAMS, OUR
PROGRAMS ARE VERY WELL ATTENDED. WE
REALLY PROMOTE EARLY LITERACY, AND
I CAN TELL YOU THAT
IN THE SUMMER, WE HAVE TO HAVE
NEW PROGRAMS. LAST WEEK, WE HAD
92 PEOPLE LINED UP FOR BABY TIME.
SO IT'S ONLY
GOING UP, IT'S NOT GOING DOWN, BECAUSE
WE BELIEVE IN EQUITY AND EVERYTHING
IS FREE IN THE LIBRARY AND NOT
EVERYONE CAN AFFORD TO GO PAY FOR DIFFERENT
PROGRAMS TO ATTEND PROGRAMS. SO EVERYBODY
COMES
TO THE LIBRARY TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET FOR FREE.
AND TO GET THEIR BANG FOR THE BUCK.
SO THE FORMULA
IS NOT
STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT'S COMPLICATED,
RIGHT? DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS AND
THE PROGRAMS.
SO, WHEN I'M GIVEN
A SUMMARY CHART THAT SAYS HERE'S OUR
EXPENSES
AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WE'RE ASKING FOR
AND THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP, YOU
KIND OF LOOK AT IT AND SAY WHAT'S
DRIVING IT? IS IT
A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES? I WANTED TO
KEEP IT SIMPLE, BUT NOW, LISTENING TO
YOU IT'S, IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT. IT SOUNDS LIKE. OKAY.
I GUESS, IN ENDING MY COMMENTS,
OR QUESTION, I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD
THE CITY HASN'T RECEIVED DETAIL,
IT WOULD BE GOOD , AT
LEAST TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL
ON THIS, SO THAT WE COULD SEE IT.
THAT'S MY ONLY
REQUEST AND RECOMMENDATION, IF WE
DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT.
THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
I USED TO BE , WHAT
DO THEY CALL, A LIAISON COMMITTEE,
ALSO FRIENDS WITH THE LIBRARIES. I
KNOW
THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE
WE ARE PROVIDING, AND DUBLIN ONLY HAS ONE LIBRARY,
AND SARAH MEL HAS
TWO, SO IN THE PAST WE TALKED ABOUT
HOW WE CAN SERVE SO MANY PEOPLE
WITH ONLY ONE LIBRARY, SO
THIS IS A GREAT WAY. MY SELF , I
SOMETIMES JUST GO THERE BECAUSE I
JUST WANT TO
HAVE A PLACE I CAN SIT DOWN WITHOUT
ANY DISTRACTIONS.
SO I THINK THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT
TO HAVE
THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR RESIDENTS,
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU TALK ABOUT
THE 5%, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE THAN CPI, SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
MAYBE WE JUST ASK STAFF TO
LOOK INTO THE DETAILS
TO MAKE SURE IT'S REASONABLE. I'M
SURE IT
IS BUT, WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER COMMENTS AND THEN, IF
YOU WANT
STAFF CAN REPORT BACK TO YOU. THE
DETAILS OF THOSE.
THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS , I THINK
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION.
GO AHEAD, VICE MAYOR. JUST TWO QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND FOR THE DETAILS.
IN TERMS OF ONLINE MATERIAL,
HOW DO YOU TRACK THAT TO A PARTICULAR BRANCH
IS MY FIRST QUESTION. AND
THE SECOND QUESTION IS, IN TERMS OF
HOURS, OBVIOUSLY WE WERE, THE COUNTY
PROVIDES THE
BASE LEVEL OF 28
, WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL 23
HOURS OF SERVICES PER WEEK,
HAVE WE LOOKED AT
HOURLY UTILIZATION,
AND IF 23 IS THE RIGHT NUMBER, AND
ARE WE EXTENDING
THE CORRECT
23 HOURS OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK.
SO WE DO HAVE A DEVICE
THAT COUNTS THE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE THAT ENTER THE BUILDING EVERY
HOUR, AND WE CAN PRODUCE THAT REPORT
THAT SHOWS
FOOT TRAFFIC AT DIFFERENT DAYS AND DIFFERENT HOURS.
WE USUALLY
LOOK AT THAT REPORT. BUT WE
HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT IN GREAT DETAIL TO SEE
, I
KNOW THAT SATURDAY, SUNDAY ARE OUR
BUSIEST DAYS, MONDAY EVENING, TUESDAY
EVENINGS ARE BUSIEST DAYS. AND WHEN
WE HAVE PROGRAMS IT'S BUSY, IT'S HARD TO PREDICT.
FOR EXAMPLE,
DECEMBER IS OUR SLOW TIME OF THE YEAR.
WHEN
KIDS GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, SO,
IT'S DIFFERENT.
IT DEPENDS ON SO MANY FACTORS. THAT
WAS ONE QUESTION, THE SECOND QUESTION
WAS ABOUT THE E-BOOKS
AND HOW YOU CONTRACT.
IT'S TRACKABLE, BECAUSE
WHEN CUSTOMERS
MAKE A LIBRARY CARD, YOU CAN DESIGNATE
DUBLIN AS A RESIDENT.
IT'S, I DON'T KNOW ,
I'M NOT
IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT
GENERATES THE REPORT. IT'S DOABLE, I'M
SURE. WE CAN GET THAT
, LIKE HOW MANY E-BOOKS ARE CHECKED OUT
BY DUBLIN RESIDENTS IS THE QUESTION I GUESS.
I WAS MORE
CURIOUS HOW YOU ATTRIBUTED TO A PARTICULAR BRANCH
AS OPPOSED
TO GENERAL IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION.
ATTRACT WHO IS USING.
WE CAN TRACK
HOW MANY NEW
CARDS WERE ISSUED TO THE CITY OF DUBLIN
RESIDENTS, FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S DOABLE.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE REPORTS,
WE CAN PRODUCE THOSE.
I WAS MORE INTERESTED
IN THE HOURLY
UTILIZATION AND TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING,
THE TYPE OF HOURS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING AS
WELL AS ARE
THOSE THE RIGHT ONES? THE QUANTITY
AS WELL
AS THE SPECIFIC TIMINGS THAT WE'RE EXTENDING.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT
INFORMATION,
I WANT TO MAKE REALLY CLEAR
THAT MY QUESTIONS WERE ABOUT THE ESCALATOR,
THE 5%
ESCALATOR, NOT THE VALUE OF THE ADDITIONAL
HOURS. I WANT TO MAKE
REALLY CLEAR THAT I'M ALL IN
ON THE ADDITIONAL HOURS, I KNOW YOU
WERE TRYING TO DEFEND THE LIBRARY,
OUR LIBRARY IN DUBLIN IS ONE OF THE
HEAVIEST UTILIZED IN THE COUNTY, WE
KNOW THAT. IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
AMENITIES WE HAVE IN DUBLIN WHEN
WE ASK, WE'RE ABOUT TO DO THE COMMUNITY
SERVICE AGAIN THAT OUR COMMITTEE RANKS
AMONG
THE HIGHEST THINGS THAT THEY LOVE ABOUT DUBLIN.
YOU ALL DO
GREAT WORK, I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
AND WHAT YOUR STAFF DOES, AND FOR
ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE HISTORY
OF WHY WE HAVE THE EXTRA HOURS THAT WE
HAVE, THAT'S A COUNCIL REQUEST. IT'S
NOT A
REQUEST FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY LIBRARY,
IT WAS ABOUT A REQUEST FROM US,
VICE MAYOR BIDDLE REQUESTED IT EVERY YEAR TO INCREASE
TWO
HOURS A YEAR, UNTIL WE GOT TO WHERE
WE ARE TO CONTINUE TO
ADD BUDGET EVERY YEAR ON EVERY BUDGET
CYCLE UNTIL WE COULD INCREASE THE
HOURS TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN NEAR AND DEAR TO COUNCIL
FOR A LONG TIME.
I SUPPORT DATA, AS
YOU KNOW, AND I AGREE WITH YOUR REQUEST
TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT ADDITIONAL
HOURS THAT ARE OPEN,
AND THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATION ABOUT FRIDAY'S,
NOT FRIDAYS OVER THE YEARS TO MAKE
SURE
THAT WE'RE OPEN THE HOURS THAT OUR
RESIDENTS WANT US TO BE OPEN, AND
IF WE EVEN MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CUT BACK
OUR RESIDENTS WOULD BE LINED UP 20
BUT THE MICROPHONE ASKING US
NOT TO DO THAT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I WAS
CLEAR, THAT MY QUESTIONS WERE NOT ABOUT
AND NOT GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF TRYING
TO REDUCE THOSE HOURS. IT IS ABOUT
WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR? WHAT GOES
INTO THAT NUMBER AND WHY AN AUTOMATIC
ESCALATOR,
WHEN IT'S BASICALLY STAFF COSTS,
INSTEAD OF
HAVING TO BE CPI EACH YEAR, WHAT'S GOING INTO THAT
ARE WE GOOD ON THIS ITEM?
OKAY. OKAY, ADDITIONAL.
5.8 .
WASTE
MANAGEMENT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
JUST A QUICK QUESTION,
THIS WAS COMING FROM COUNCILMEMBER
MORADA AROUND WHY
WE DON'T HAVE A RATE HIKE CEILING
ON OUR CONTRACTS FOR THE WASTE MANAGEMENT.
AND SEEMS LIKE HIS WORDS,
WERE AT
A DISADVANTAGE EVERY TIME GIVEN THESE CONTRACTS ARE LONG-TERM,
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND
THE QUESTION, THE QUESTION IS WHY
DO WE NOT HAVE A MAX ANNUAL RATE?
FOR OUR CONTRACTS? DISPOSAL CONTRACT?
IT'S MORE,
WITHOUT ANY CEILING TO THAT, ANY LIMIT
TO THAT UPPER LIMIT, LOOKING AT THE
YEAR OVER
YEAR INCREASES.
SO, FOR DISPOSAL, THERE IS
A GREAT
LIMIT, A RATE ADJUSTMENT, FOR THE
FIRST YEAR IT'S 6%, FOR YEARS
TWO THROUGH 10,
IT'S 7%.
THE REASON WHY IT GOES UP A LITTLE BIT
IS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN
IN THIS CONTRACT WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT
THE PREVIOUS 10 YEARS, AND THEY'VE FALLEN BEHIND
ON THE DISPOSAL RATES .
SO, WE'RE
ALLOWING A LITTLE BIT OF A CATCH-UP,
SO IT'S BASICALLY CPI PLUS A
MAX 3.5% FOR THAT CATCH-UP,
BUT IT CAN'T EXCEED 7% PER YEAR.
FOR DISPOSAL.
FOR ORGANICS,
THERE IS NOT A CEILING,
IN THE AGREEMENT,
BUT THE RATE IS
BETTER THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD,
AND OF COURSE WE HAVE TO APPROVE THESE
RATES. THE CITY APPROVED THE RATES ANNUALLY, SO
IF THEY'RE PROPOSING SOMETHING THAT'S EXCESSIVE,
THEN WE
CAN DENY THOSE ADJUSTMENTS.
OKAY, AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE RECYCLING
RECYCLING IN THIS CONTRACT?
WE'RE IN
NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW WITH ACI, ALAMEDA COUNTY
, RECYCLING IS NOT PART
OF THIS AGREEMENT.
AND JUST, MY QUESTION
, ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION IS, THE
WAY I UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT THERE'S A COST
FOR OPERATING IN TERMS OF THE WASTE
AND ALL OF THAT, AND THEN
THERE'S SOME SET PERCENTAGE AS AN
OVERAGE ADMIN TYPE FEE IN
TERMS OF ESTABLISHING THE RATE. IS THAT CORRECT?
SO, FOR
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THERE
IS THE
TIPPING FEES, THAT IS WHAT IS IN THIS AGREEMENT.
THAT'S THE DISPOSAL FEE, AND THEN
THERE'S THE GOVERNMENT FEES.
THOSE GOVERNMENT
FEES ARE FEES THAT ARE NOT PAID TO
US, I'M SORRY, I DON'T
HAVE THEM ALL LISTED, HH W FEES, THERE'S
ALL OF THESE FEES
THAT VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CHARGE,
THOSE FEES
DON'T REALLY CHANGE VERY MUCH. IN FACT, THEY
CHANGE VERY VERY LITTLE FROM THE CURRENT CONTRACT.
I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY,
IT'S PENNIES ON CHANGE,
SO THOSE FEES ARE MORE OR LESS STABLE OVER TIME.
IT'S JUST THE COST FOR PROCESSING
THE LANDFILL DISPOSAL. THAT'S WHAT CHANGES
YEARLY.
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATIONS.
THANK YOU. YOU'RE GOOD? OKAY, GOOD. SO,
5.10.
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION?
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY ON 5.10, WHY
WE WOULDN'T WANT TO
ENFORCE THAT
AS OPPOSED TO OUTSOURCING.
IN SOURCE THE
FUNCTION OF LANLOGIC?
THE REASON, THE MAIN REASON
WE DO IT IS WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COST-EFFECTIVELY
GET THAT KIND OF SKILL
SET THAT WE USE LANLOGIC FOR, WHICH IS
HIGH-LEVEL NETWORKING, DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS, THE X RAIL,
AND OTHER SKILL SETS
THAT WE DON'T HAVE
THOSE HIGH-LEVEL, IT WOULD NOT BE
COST-EFFECTIVE TO
DO THAT. EACH ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
175 AND 200,
AS A BASE SALARY PLUS BURDEN.
AND IT WOULD NEVER EVEN OUT. WE
PAY ABOUT A FIFTH OF THAT,
TO GET ALL THOSE SKILL SETS, INSIDE LANLOGIC.
IT'S A FRACTIONAL WORK
ACROSS THOSE AREAS. PERFECT, THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS.
SO HOW DO WE GO WITH
ALL THE ITEMS?
HAPPY TO
MAKE A MOTION FOR 5.2, 5.7, ALL OF THEM.
5.2, 5.5,
5.7, 5.8, 5.10.
I'LL SECOND. SO WE JUST
ALL IN FAVOR SAY
AYE.
SO THOSE ITEMS APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY,
THANK YOU. AND LET'S MOVE ON TO
ITEM SIX, PUBLIC HEARING.
6.1, ADOPTION OF RATES
FOR GARBAGE COLLECTION, DISPOSAL,
AND RECYCLING SERVICES PROVIDED BY
AVI, AND ESTABLISHING
2025 TO 2026, A NEW ASSESSMENT.
GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE MAYOR,
J BLACK STUFF, FINANCE DIRECTOR.
I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE
ADOPTION OF RATES FOR THE GARBAGE COLLECTION FOR 25-26.
JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND, AMADOR VALLEY
INDUSTRIES BEGAN PROVIDING
SERVICES IN 2005 TO THE CITY OF DUBLIN.
THE CONTRACT WAS EXTENDED IN 2020,
IT WAS EXTENDED FOR 15
YEARS TO 2035. WE WERE NOTIFIED IN 2034,
BY AVI,
THAT THEY INTENDED TO SELL THE COMPANY TO
LIVERMORE SANITATION INC. OR LSI.
LATER IN THE YEAR, THE ASSIGNMENT
OF THE AGREEMENT TO LSI WAS APPROVED
BY THE CITY COUNCIL. PART OF THAT WAS
THE AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT THAT
WAS EXECUTED THEN IN 2025.
THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES
FOR AN ANNUAL RATE ADJUSTMENT,
ADJUSTMENTS ARE BASED ON MULTIPLE
FACTORS INCLUDING CPI INDEXES, NUMBER
OF BUILD UNITS, ANNUAL GROWTH SERVICE,
ANNUAL
TONNAGE AND DISPOSAL FEES.
FOR 25-26, THE RATE INCREASE
FOR ALL SERVICES IS RECOMMENDED TO INCREASE 4.06%.
AND THIS WILL PUT THE NEW BASELINE
RESIDENTIAL AT $44.66 A MONTH. THAT IS
$1.70 FOR A MONTH INCREASE.
DUBLIN BASELINE SERVICE IS PLACED
ON THE PROPERTY TAX BILL.
THE RATES ARE GOING UP, AS I MENTIONED, THAT
EQUATES TO 2088 PER YEAR.
SO, HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO VARIOUS CITIES,
AROUND OUR AREA?
SAN RAMON, IS AT 52
, THIS IS THEIR BASELINE RATE.
WHICH IS $7.45 HIGHER,
LIVERMORE IS AT $40.73, $3.93 LOWER, CASTRO VALLEY
IS AT 55.49, $10.
AND $.83.
AND THEN PLEASANTON,
IS KIND OF AN OUTLIER, AND IS AT
32.78, ATTACHMENT EIGHT WE LAY OUT THE
COMPARISON AND WE DO A
THREE CITY COMPARISON
, WE USE TO
INCLUDE PLEASANTON BUT WE HAVE SINCE REMOVED THEM BECAUSE
ARE AN OUTLIER. THE QUESTION HAS COME UP,
WHY IS IT SO LOW? WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
INTO THAT AS
MUCH AS WE CAN FIND. WE'VE TALKED WITH
ONE OF OUR CONSULTANTS, AND
FROM THEM, ONE OF
THE BIG REASONS IS , AT LEAST
FROM AN EFFICIENCY STANDPOINT, IS
THAT THEIR VEHICLES ARE PARKED
PLEASANTON, AND THAT THEIR TRANSFER
STATION IS IN TOWN.
THEY SAY THAT BY HAVING EVERYTHING
LOCATED IN THE CITY THAT YOU'RE
PERFORMING THE SERVICE IN,
IT ADDS AN HOUR OF PRODUCTIVITY EFFICIENCY
AS OPPOSED TO DUBLIN WHERE THEY NEED
TO GO PICK UP
THE TRUCKS, DRIVE BACK, DRIVE TO DUBLIN AND
GO DOWN, WE DON'T HAVE THAT TRANSPORTATION,
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE LANDFILL.
BUT ANOTHER PIECE THAT HAPPENED IS THEIR TRANSFER STATION
, JUST LIKE WE DO APPRECIATE
ANY CAPITAL ASSETS, THEIR TRANSFER STATION WAS DEPRECIATED,
AND AROUND 2020 IT WAS FULLY DEPRECIATED.
SO, THAT CAME OFF, SO THAT WOULD HAVE REDUCED
THE AMOUNT TO BEGIN WITH, BUT IT WAS ALSO FOUND
THAT THEY HAD OVER DEPRECIATED, SO THAT
MONEY
HAD TO GO BACK TO THE RATEPAYERS.
TAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION
AND IT GETS THEM TO A VERY
LOW RATE, SO THAT DEPRECIATION DROPPED
THE RATES
BY 13% THAT YEAR. SO THAT'S A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNT.
AND AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW ALL OF
IT, WE CAN'T SEE EVERYTHING BUT FROM
OUR RESEARCH THAT'S WHAT WE'VE FOUND.
SO, FOR OUR ANNUAL RATE ADJUSTMENT,
WE LOOK AT FOUR DIFFERENT AREAS,
INDEX ADJUSTMENT, WHICH
WE CALL OUR I, THIS IS A WEIGHTED
CPI WE LOOK AT THREE INDEXES AND WAIT
IT AGAINST ANNUAL COST,
ADD EVERYTHING UP, AND THE REASON
WE DO THAT IS,
THAT WAY IN
CASE ONE OF THE INDICES IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER,
DOESN'T ARTIFICIALLY INCREASE EVERYTHING.
WEIGHTED IS MEANT TO BALANCE EVERYTHING OUT.
THEN WE LOOK AT ANNUAL GROWTH, THAT'S LOOKING AT
TWO POINTS IN
TIME, JANUARY TO DECEMBER, THAT'S
THE NUMBER OF UNITS
SERVED. THAT'S RESIDENTIAL, EVERYTHING.
IN TERMS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
ONE THING TO NOTE
IS THAT IF THE CHANGE IS NEGATIVE,
IT'S SET AT ZERO. APPROVED TIP FEE,
AS SHANNON WAS MENTIONING,
HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD AN AGREEMENT
WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT
ONLY FOR SOLID WASTE.
WE'VE
ALWAYS RELIED ON AVI, AND THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY.
LANDFILLS FOR ORGANICS AND RECYCLING, WE NOW RECENTLY
ARE IN A CONTRACT WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT FOR ORGANICS,
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DO
A FIRST PARTY AGREEMENT WITH RECYCLING.
SO, THAT'S A NEW
CHANGE, BUT HAVING A LONG-TERM AGREEMENT
IN CASE GIVES
US STABILITY AND CREDIBILITY, THE MARCUS
FOR ANYBODY WHO'S LISTENED TO ME,
THE MARKETS HAVE JUMPED ALL OVER
THE PLACE ESPECIALLY WITH ORGANICS AND RECYCLING.
AND ANNUAL TONNAGE, THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF STUFF
THAT IS DISPOSED
OF, GARBAGE, ORGANICS, RECYCLING.
SO, THE BIGGEST COST
IN ALL OF THIS IS THE
COLLECTION ELEMENT. THAT'S JUST EVERYTHING
ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLLECTION OF
GARBAGE,
ORGANICS, RECYCLING, THAT'S EVERYTHING THAT
HAS TO DO WITH PICKING
UP THOSE THREE. ITEMS.
ADJUSTED ANNUALLY BY THE RR I, CIP AND ANNUAL GROWTH.
COMMERCIAL RECYCLING IS AN
ELEMENT THAT WAS CREATED TO INCENTIVIZE
COMMERCIAL RECYCLING, WHEN WE DID THE
AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT
WE BASICALLY RESET THAT, SO WE DO THE ANNUAL CALCULATION
AND APPLY A $421,795 CREDIT
FOR THAT, SO WE BACK THAT OUT.
WHEN I SHOW YOU THE
CHART OF THE COST ELEMENTS, THAT ONE
IS LOW, IT'S AT $72,000.
THEN WASTE DISPOSAL, CITY
HAS RENEGOTIATED THE LONG-TERM CONTRACT WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT.
THAT IS ANNUAL TONNAGE
TIMES TIP
FEE, THAT'S A SIMPLE PASS THROUGH TO THE CONSUMER.
WE ALSO HAVE A CONTAINER COMPENSATION ELEMENT
, A REPLACEMENT OF BINS, THAT'S THE ANNUAL GROWTH FACTOR.
CUSTOMERS GET ADDED ON,
THEY'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO REPLACE THE BINS, AND THAT'S HOW THAT'S CAPTURED.
RECYCLING DISPOSAL, WE ARE CURRENTLY
THROUGH AVI TAKING ALL
OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIAL
TO ACI IN SAN LEANDRO, HOPING TO HAVE
A FIRST
PARTY AGREEMENT WITH THEM
25-26,
CURRENTLY WE PAY MARKET RATE, AND THEN
IN THE AGREEMENT, THAT SHOULD
ALL BE LAID OUT OF PRICE AND INCREASES
THAT SORT OF THING.
THAT IS THE
ANNUAL TONNAGE TIMES THE ANNUAL TIP
FEE, AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE CURRENTLY
WORKING ON THAT AGREEMENT. AND ORGANICS,
THIS IS NEW TO
US, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY PROCESSED
EVERYTHING THROUGH AVI'S VENDORS.
THEY'RE
OVER, WE ACTUALLY HAD TO TRUCK
A LOT OF THIS OUTSIDE OF THE AREA.
SO, THE
GOOD THING WITH THIS IS IT WILL BE LOCAL.
IT'S NOT AS FAR AS
WE HAVE TO TAKE, THE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT
IS CALCULATED, IT'S THE TONNAGE AND
THE ANNUAL DISPOSAL FEE. BECAUSE WE HAD TO TRUCK
THE ORGANICS OUTSIDE OF THE AREA,
THERE WAS A HOLDING FEE
THAT WAS INCORPORATED. NOW THAT WE
HAVE THE NEW AGREEMENT, WE'RE GOING
NEED TO SPEAK WITH LSI AND LOOK AT
REMOVING THAT, WHEN LOOKING AT THE TWO
FEES,
THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR. THE ACTUAL DISPOSAL FEE IS
ABOUT
THE SAME WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION
THE NEW RATE
WE'LL BE PAYING VERSUS THE LOWER RATE PLUS
THE HOLDING FEE, IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE
TO TAKE IT OVER TO THE CENTRAL
VALLEY, BUT THERE'S A HOLDING FEE, BUT
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT,
ANY SAVINGS WE GET FROM ANY OF THESE
AGREEMENTS, FIRST PARTY AGREEMENTS WILL
IMMEDIATELY
GO BACK TO THE RATEPAYERS.
AND VEHICLE AND ADMINISTRATION ELEMENTS, THIS
IS CAPTURE AT ALL COSTS, THIS IS OUR CAPITAL, ART APPRECIATION.
THIS WILL
COME OFF AS SOON AS THE ASSETS ARE FULLY DEPRECIATED.
THIS DOES NOT GET INCREASED EACH
YEAR, IT'S SET AT
THE AMOUNT, AND IT JUST CARRIES OVER
UNTIL IT'S FULLY DEPRECIATED.
THE LAST ELEMENT IS THE FRANCHISE
FEE, WHICH IS BASED ON A
PERCENTAGE OF AVI'S REVENUE.
THIS SUMMARIZES ALL OF THE ELEMENTS,
AS YOU CAN SEE THE COLLECTION
ELEMENT IS BY FAR THE LARGEST. WITH
ALL THE OTHER FEES BROKEN OUT.
AND YOU CAN SEE
THE VEHICLE AND ADMINISTRATION ELEMENT IS
SET AT THE $1.6 MILLION.
IN TOTAL, IT IS A
$1.3 MILLION INCREASE, AND THAT'S
WHERE WE APPLY THE 4.06%
TO GENERATE THE REVENUE.
SO, SINCE THIS IS
ON THE PROPERTY TAX,
WE NEED TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING, DELIBERATE,
AND APPROVED THE RESOLUTIONS AMENDING
SCHEDULE OF SERVICE RATES
FOR INTEGRATED SOLID WASTE SERVICES
AND APPROVE THE RESOLUTION,
APPROVING AND ESTABLISHING THE COLLECTION
OF MINIMUM RESIDENTIAL GARBAGE AND
RECYCLING SERVICE
FEES FOR FISCAL YEAR 25-26. THE SECOND
IS PLACING
IT ON THE TAX ROLL. AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
SO, WE'LL
ASK QUESTIONS FIRST, GO AHEAD.
THE PRESENTATION, YOU KNOW I'M
GOING TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.
THE ORGANICS, THE
NEW ORGANICS CONTRACT THAT WE JUST
APPROVED IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS, CORRECT?
WILL THAT BE, I KNOW
THE COST IS A WASH
BETWEEN THE OLD WITH THE HOLDING FEE, AND
SO WE WILL SEE THAT
UPDATED
NEXT YEAR, IS THAT RIGHT? YOU WON'T
UPDATED THIS YEAR AT ALL?
WE CAN'T, ONCE THEY CLOSE THE ROLE.
I'M GOING TO JUMP AROUND A LITTLE BIT,
THAT ROLLED ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION
WHICH IS, YOU SAID
THAT IF WE SEE A SAVINGS WITH
IF WE SAW A SAVINGS IT
WOULD IMMEDIATELY GO BACK TO THE RATEPAYERS.
MAY BE IMMEDIATE WASN'T. SO,
WE WOULD ROLL
THAT INTO NEXT YEAR'S RATE, CORRECT?
OTHERWISE WE
WOULD HAVE TO HOLD ANOTHER HEARING.
BUT, WE WOULD ROLL THAT
INTO NEXT YEAR'S
AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE'LL ALSO
HOPEFULLY BE HAVING RECYCLING. SO
WE'LL WORK WITH LSI ON
READJUSTING THAT
WAY WE CALCULATE THAT.
WHICH SEGUES BEAUTIFULLY INTO
THE GROWTH FACTOR CONVERSATION.
WHICH, AS YOU KNOW FROM PRIOR YEARS, I
HATE THAT
ELEMENT. NOT ONLY IS THE FLOOR BEING
AT ZERO PROBLEMATIC FOR ME, BUT
THE WAY WE USE
THE CENSUS, THE TOTAL CENSUS RESIDENTIAL WE
DON'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO.
I FIND PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE
WE HAVE A TON OF NEW HOUSES,
THEN OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS HAVING
THEIR RATES GO UP A LITTLE BIT
, MORE THAN IT SHOULD. AND CONVERSELY
IF WE HAD A WHOLE NEW
COMMERCIAL CENTER COME ONLINE,
THEN OUR RESIDENTS END UP PAYING A
LITTLE BIT MORE FOR THAT. IS THERE
A WAY THAT WE CAN RENEGOTIATE THAT
ELEMENT SO THAT WE SPLIT THE GROWTH
, IT WOULD MEAN THAT
THE RESIDENT RATE AND THE COMMERCIAL RATE
MIGHT ADJUST
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
, PERCENTAGEWISE, BUT THAT COMMERCIAL GROWTH
WOULD BE PLACED
, THE PERCENTAGE WILL
BE PLACED ON THE COMMERCIAL,
AND THE RESIDENTIAL GROWTH WOULD BE
PLACED ON THE RESIDENTIAL
CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD BE MORE EQUITABLE,
I THINK, FOR
LACK OF A BETTER WORD.
IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT THAT?
THERE'S NO EASY WAY AS EVERYTHING
IS SET UP NOW.
WE'RE SORRY,
GO AHEAD.
ON THE COLLECTION ELEMENT
, EVERYTHING
JUST THROWN INTO THAT POT, THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COSTS WERE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE.
NOT SAY
IT CAN'T BE DONE BUT THE WAY IT CURRENTLY
IS AND THE WAY IT'S
CURRENTLY WRITTEN INTO THE CONTRACT.
WE WOULD HAVE TO ESSENTIALLY HIT THE RESET BUTTON.
THE WAY WE CALCULATE THAT, WE MULTIPLY,
WE KNOW WHERE NEW SERVICE
HAS BEEN ADDED. BECAUSE
WE MULTIPLY THAT CENSUS
BY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT.
SO, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULDN'T BE THAT HARD
ONE THING TO POINT OUT, THAT IT IS
UP TO YOUR DISCRETION, WE'VE ALWAYS
APPLIED THE
RATE ACROSS EVERYTHING. THAT DOESN'T
MEAN YOU HAVE TO.
WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT ARBITRARILY, WHICH IS,
IT WAS STRICTLY
ARBITRARY, DID WE WANT TO HOLD THE SAME
ORSAY, WE WANT TO
KEEP THE RESIDENTIAL PERCENTAGE
AT A CERTAIN RATE, IN ORDER TO GET
THE TOTAL, THE TOTAL GUARANTEED
TO BE THE RIGHT
AMOUNT, WE CAN ADJUST, BUT WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY DATA BEHIND IT IN THE PAST
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA OF DOING
THAT. WE WOULD WANT, I
PERSONALLY WOULD WANT TO HAVE ,
GOING UP BY THIS MUCH BECAUSE COMMERCIAL
GROWTH, JUST FOR THAT ONE ELEMENT.
BASED
OFF THE CENSUS, THE INFORMATION, WE
HAVE THE INFORMATION AND WE CAN DO
CALCULATION THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY
SAY, GROWTH FACTOR FOR COMMERCIAL,
AND FOR RESIDENTIAL IT'S Y.
THEN COME BACK TO YOU AND
RECOMMEND THAT EACH BE ADJUSTED BY THAT. AMOUNT.
WE WOULDN'T BE ,
BUT, AT LEAST WE WOULD HAVE THAT DATA GOING
FORWARD WHICH WOULD BE CERTAINLY HELPFUL TO HAVE
EVEN
IF WE CHOSE, WE'D RATHER
RAISE IT ALL THE SAME AMOUNT.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
I'VE
NEVER APPROACHED IT THAT WAY, THAT
IS DEFINITELY, IT WOULD BE AN EXTRA STEP.
AS LONG AS THAT'S DOABLE,
THAT'S INFORMATION I WOULD LOVE TO
SEE NEXT TIME. AND THEN,
JUST TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND,
THE AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE, THE
FIRST PARTY AGREEMENTS WITH WASTE
MANAGEMENT, THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL
FEE ON TOP OF THOSE THAT WE GET CHARGED
BY OUR HOLDER TO HONOR THOSE .
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE
FEE, THEY JUST HONOR THE AGREEMENT
THAT WE HAVE WITH
WASTE MANAGEMENT. WASTE MANAGEMENT
CHARGES
THEM THOSE TIPPING FEES.
FOR WASTE DISPOSAL
, I BELIEVE FOR
ORGANICS IN THE PAST,
BECAUSE IT WAS THEIR AGREEMENT, THERE
WAS THE OVERHEAD ATTACHED TO THAT.
BUT WITH HER
RIGHT NOW WITH GARBAGE,
WE NEGOTIATED
THE RATE, ABI PAYS THAT TIPPING FEE,
IT'S PASSED ON DIRECTLY WITH
NO ADDITIONAL, AND THAT'S WHAT THE
NEW ORGANICS WILL BE LIKE.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE'LL NEED TO DISCUSS.
SINCE THIS IS NEW
TO US, IN THE AGREEMENT, IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL NEED TO.
THAT'S MY QUESTIONS, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. ANY
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM YOU?
COUNCILMEMBER ADDRESSED IT MORE THOROUGHLY,
THAT I COULD, AND IT WAS ABOUT THE
IMBALANCE OR HOW THE TWO
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL EQUALIZE, AND HOW
COME I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY GOOD COMMENT.
I HAVE A REALLY SMALL COMMENT HERE,
I WAS LOOKING AT IT,
YOU BREAK OUT BY
KANSAI'S, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR RESIDENTIAL.
AND I NOTICED THAT,
IS THE 64th OR
70 EVEN USED? WE GET 32 AND 96 IS
ACCORDING TO WHAT I
READ. BUT, HOW ARE WE COMING UP WITH THIS FACTOR HERE
FOR THE MIDDLE RANGE? IT LOOKS LIKE
IT EXCEEDS
THE AVERAGE. IT'S JUST TWEAKING.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT THAT, I'M LOOKING
AT YOUR COMPARISON
CHART YOUR EXCEL SPREADSHEET.
THE 60,
IS IT UTILIZED?
I THINK 64, THERE IS
A LITTLE UNDER 3000. THAT
UTILIZE IT. IT WOULD BE AN UPGRADE FROM THE 32,
AND THE 96 IS A LOT LESS, THERE'S ONLY 300.
AND THEN, THERE'S LESS THAN
10 THAT HAVE TWO 32.
IT'S A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT.
THAT WON'T BE IN ANYTHING, THAT'S
JUST
IN OUR CENSUS DATA. THE REPORTING WE GET. SO,
PEOPLE ARE NOT.
17,400 RESIDENTIAL UNITS.
FOR CUSTOMERS. AND ABOUT 3000
OF THEM UTILIZE THE 64.
THAT'S STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.
I WAS
JUST WONDERING WHY THAT NUMBER, EVERYTHING ELSE
TURNED,
A LITTLE
DIFFERENT, A LITTLE LESS
THAN OR SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE
THREE CITY AVERAGE AND THAT
WOULD JUST KIND OF POPPED UP. A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE.
IF YOU HAVE THAT ANSWER, IF NOT, IT'S NOT DEAD.
SEE WHAT I'M GETTING AT?
LIVERMORE
ON AVERAGE.
85, CASTRO IS 76.
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
WHY LIVERMORE'S, I BELIEVE OURS IS
JUST A FACTOR OF WHATEVER THE 32 IS.
LIKE 50%?
FOR THOSE 3000 CUSTOMERS.
IT WAS SET IN '05
AND WE'VE BEEN ADDING ON, I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY CAME UP
WITH.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M FINE. I GOT
MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.
VICE MAYOR?
I'VE GOT
THREE, I THINK THREE
QUICK QUESTIONS. THE FIRST
IS BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER MORADA'S
QUESTION, I WAS ASKING THAT PREMATURELY
AROUND THE
RECYCLING PIECE OF IT. IF WE HAVE
ANY CEILINGS, RATE HIKE CEILINGS,
IF NOT, WHY?
10%.
FOR RECYCLING?
NO, THAT'S FOR THE
RR I FACTOR, CPI.
THAT'S THE AMALGAMATION OF FOUR DIFFERENT FACTORS?
THREE DIFFERENT FACTORS , TIMES THEIR COST.
SET
AT 10.
OKAY. TO BE HONEST,
IT'S NEVER GONE THAT HIGH. OKAY.
SECOND QUESTION IS
, HAVE WE EVER LOOKED AT
SOME SORT OF DISCOUNT, OR ACCOMMODATIONS
FOR LOW OR FIXED INCOME RESIDENTS?
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
LIVERMORE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CITY THAT HAS IT.
IT'S BUILT INTO THEIR AGREEMENT, SO
IT'S A
COST, THE BURDEN IS ON THE HAULER.
I THINK THE HARD PART
FOR US IS WE PUT THINGS ON THE PROPERTY TAX
THE WAY WE CALCULATE IT,
IF SOMEBODY IS SUBSIDIZED, SOMEBODY ELSE
IS PAYING FOR IT, AND THAT BECOMES
A PROP 218 ISSUE.
YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT
THE GENERAL FUND COULD SUBSIDIZE IT.
IF I COULD. BECAUSE OF THE PROP
218 PROBLEM, IT
WOULD HAVE TO BE GENERAL FUND. LIVERMORE
DOES HAVE A PROGRAM
FOR LOW INCOME SUBSCRIBERS THAT ALSO
ARE
SUBSCRIBED TO PG&E CHAIRS. SO THEY
CAN GET A LARGER
CAN FOR THE SMALLER CAN PRICE.
THAT'S BUILT INTO THE AGREEMENT, THAT'S ON THEM.
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN
CERTAINLY TALK TO OUR PROVIDER ABOUT, THAT WAS INTERESTING.
TO ME. BUT, IF WE WERE TO DO IT OURSELVES,
WE WOULD BE CHALLENGED. I THINK WE
WOULD END UP SUBSIDIZING
FROM THE GENERAL FUND.
IS THAT
SOMETHING YOU CAN INVESTIGATE ON AS
WE'RE LOOKING INTO
THOSE CONTACTS YOU MARK
YEAH, I THINK PART OF IT
WOULD BE LOOKING TO SEE OTHER CITIES
THAT HAVE IT ON THE PROPERTY
TAX, IT'S LIKE 50-50. TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY SUBSIDY.
MY THOUGHT
WAS A LOT OF IT, THEY
PUT IN THEIR AGREEMENT THAT THE HAULER
HAS TO, BUT
WE CAN LOOK INTO IT.
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS,
CAN THE DIVING INTO THE FEE
COMPENSATION PIECE OF IT
, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY,
THERE'S A FRANCHISE FEE 16.35
ADMIN FEE OF 7% , SO
TOTAL FEE COMPENSATION ELEMENT IS 23.35.
LOOKS LIKE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IS
4.6% INCREASE.
BUT, IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE WE USE
, THE MORE WE
PAY, SO IT'S, IF I UNDERSTAND IT'S ABI REVENUE,
IT'S BASED ON
ABI REVENUE. OKAY.
IS THERE A WAY TO
NEGOTIATE THAT? IT SEEMS QUITE HIGH. WE'RE TALKING
IN THE 7 MILLION RANGE.
PER ANNA.
WE WOULD NEED TO
COME BACK TO YOU. AND STUDY THAT TOPIC
A LITTLE BIT. I WOULD SEEK DIRECTION
FROM A
MAJORITY OF YOU ON THAT.
OKAY, THOSE WERE MY QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
REAL QUICK. ATTACHMENT SIX,
HAVE A COMPARISON WITH OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES.
SO, ARE RESIDENTIAL RATES
LOOK GREAT.
AND AN AVERAGE OF THREE CITIES.
LOWER. AND FOR
COMMERCIAL IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN
AVERAGE OF THREE CITIES. WHAT ARE
THE REASONS FOR THAT?
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
PART OF IT IS WITH COMMERCIAL,
THAT WE CHARGE 50%, I
MIGHT GET THIS BACKWARD, FOR ORGANICS
AND 25% FOR RECYCLING.
RECYCLING AND ORGANICS, ESPECIALLY
RECYCLING HAS GONE FROM SOMETHING
THAT A HOLDER CAN
MAKE MONEY ON TO BASICALLY BREAKEVEN,
TO WHERE IT COSTS MORE, THREE TIMES
MORE TO DISPOSE OF RECYCLING THAN
IS FOR SOLID WASTE. A LOT OF THESE CITIES
CHARGE UP TO 100%
OF THEIR GARBAGE RATE FOR RECYCLING AND ORGANIC.
I THINK I'VE SAID IT IN PRIOR YEARS,
IT'S GETTING HARDER
TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES WHEN YOU
LOOK JUST AT THE SOLID WASTE.
BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE
DEPENDING ON THE CITY, THEY CHARGE
100% FOR ORGANICS AND
RECYCLING, THEY COULD BE PAYING MORE
IN TOTAL THAN IF, I WAS GOING TO SAY
THE WRONG CITY, DUBLIN.
JUST BECAUSE OF THE MAKEUP, WE CHARGE
50% AND
IS 25%. DOES THAT ANSWER? YEAH, IT'S
THOSE STREAMS ARE NOW.
THE DIFFERENT PARTS.
SO, THE QUESTION IS, HAVE YOU
HEARD ANY FEEDBACK FROM RESIDENTS OR
COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ABOUT
, ANY
FEEDBACK ABOUT THESE SERVICES?
NO,
VERY RARELY.
DO WE DO ANY SURVEY OR ANYTHING?
SHANNON.
USUALLY TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL.
HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS
FROM THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE, BUT
I'LL ASK SHANNON TO
ADDRESS THAT.
FROM TIME
TO TIME WE GET FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC,
BUT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
ON A REGULAR OCCURRENCE.
WE'LL GET
FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC. FROM TIME
TO TIME. USUALLY IT'S ABOUT EARLY
PICKUPS. SO
THERE'S TIMES THAT ABI IS SUPPOSED TO
SERVICE NOT TOO EARLY, AND OBVIOUSLY
NOT TOO LATE, NOT TOO LATE IS
NOT USUALLY A PROBLEM. BUT WE DON'T
GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK
FROM THE PUBLIC ON THE SERVICES.
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB.
HOPEFULLY THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS.
THAT'S GREAT, THANK YOU.
SO, THAT'S ALL OUR QUESTIONS.
WE'LL START THE HEARING, THE PUBLIC HEARING.
MAYOR, I HAVE NO SPEAKER SLIPS ON
THIS ITEM.
SO WE'LL CLOSE
THE HEARING. AND ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS?
COUNCIL WANTS TO MAKE, GO AHEAD.
I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK, THIS
A HUGE CONTRACT WITH A LOT OF ELEMENTS,
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE,
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
MOVING PARTS, THE INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED,
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS DRASTICALLY.
I SIT ON STOP WASTE AS WELL, I
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT
GARBAGE
AND RECYCLING THAT I'D LIKE TO.
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING,
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD
THAT WE
CAN SEE WHAT WE CAN DO THAT GROWTH FACTOR.
TO TALK ABOUT THAT ,
AND THAT DATA GOING FORWARD WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL
FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND OUR BUSINESSES TO KNOW
THAT WE'RE RAISING RATES EQUITABLY.
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHILE THIS
IS A 4% INCREASE, UNDER 2%, WASN'T IT?
UNDER 1%.
ON A TWO YEAR AVERAGE, WE'RE NOT DOING BADLY
FOR CPI. I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO KEEP
COSTS DOWN FOR OUR RESIDENTS IS GREAT,
I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR FOLKS THAT ARE
ON A FIXED INCOME, FOCUSED
USING PG&E CARES OR SOME OTHER METRIC
THAT WE USE, IF
THERE IS A WAY THAT CAN HELP THEM
OUT A LITTLE BIT. WHETHER IT'S, I DON'T
THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL
TO GIVE
THEM A LARGER CAN FOR THE PRICE OF
A SMALLER CAN, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT IS NECESSARY, WE OPEN THE CONTRACT.
THEN I THINK
THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO.
OTHER THAN THAT
WE'VE DONE A JOB HERE IN KEEPING THINGS
LOW AS WE CAN.
IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT, AND I APPRECIATE THAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FIRST PARTY AGREEMENTS
TRY TO KNOTHOLE THINGS AS FAR AS WE
HAVE BEEN, I THINK
THAT'S, THANK YOU.
COMMENTS FROM
YOU? ADDITIONAL COMMENTS?
NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.
I APPRECIATE THE WORK AS WELL, THANK YOU
FOR GOING THROUGH ALL OF
THAT, AND ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS.
I'M SORT OF STUCK AT
WHAT'S POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF
NEGOTIATING OR RENEGOTIATING SOME
OF THOSE
CONTRACTS AND THE FIRST PARTY CONTRACTS
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE, I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE'S INTEREST IN THE COUNCIL
PAUSING THIS NOW AND LOOKING INTO
NOW, OR IF THEY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR,
I KNOW THERE ARE TIMELINES IN TERMS
OF THE TAX ROLL
AND GETTING OUT OF THE TAX BILL, I
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S THAT SENSE OF
URGENCY OR IMMEDIACY NOW, OR IF WE
WANT TO REVISIT THIS IN ONE YEARS TIME.
LET'S CLARIFY THAT, WHAT'S THE TIMING?
WHAT'S THE TIMING, THE URGENCY,
TO ADDRESS HIS QUESTION
TO MARK I'D LIKE CLARIFICATION ON THAT.
ASSUMING THIS IS A PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO
BE TAKEN CARE OF NOW.
THEY WILL START BILLING JULY 1st,
WE NEED TO GET INFORMATION
TO OUR CONSULTANTS WHO PUT IT
ON THE TAX ROLL, I'LL PROBABLY, BY
THE END OF
THIS MONTH AT THE ABSOLUTE LATEST,
I WILL SEND
IT TO THEM AS SOON AS THE RESOLUTIONS
ARE PASSED, IT TAKES TIME TO
PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND GET IT
OVER TO THE COUNTY.
THERE IS A SENSE OF
URGENCY, AND I ECHO, I GUESS, I DO
HAVE SOME FINAL COMMENTS.
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE
BY COUNCIL HERE. GETTING MORE DETAIL,
SPLITTING IT OUT. JUST MORE OF
, A LITTLE MORE ANALYSIS DONE, HERE, FOR US.
AND THAT'S REALLY IT. IF THERE'S
A SENSE OF URGENCY, I JUST BACK OFF THAT ONE. YEAH.
WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GREAT WORK AND THANKS
FOR,
THE GREAT WORK. THAT'S
THE BEST COMPLIMENT,
FOR THE WASTE MANAGEMENT.
AND THANK YOU, AND YOU WANT TO MAKE A
MOTION?
I WILL, BUT
I'M ON THE WRONG PAGE.
MAKE A MOTION THAT WE APPROVE THE
RESOLUTION APPROVING AND ESTABLISHING
THE COLLECTION OF
MINIMUM RESIDENTIAL GARBAGE AND RECYCLING SERVICE FEES
FOR FISCAL 25-26.
PERFECT, I'LL
SECOND THAT MOTION.
ALL
IN FAVOR SAY AYE.
AYE. MOTION PASSED
UNANIMOUSLY. DO WE WANT
TO TAKE
LIKE TWO MINUTES BREAK? OR WE'RE OKAY
TO GO ON? NO?
WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.
YEAH. WE WILL HAVE
A GOOD TOPIC.
[ THE EVENT IS ON A RECESS. CAPTIONER STANDING BY. ]
IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.
AGENDA ITEM 7.1, PRELIMINARY FISCAL YEAR
2025-26 GENERAL FUND BUDGET UPDATE.
GOOD EVENING, AGAIN.
TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE GENERAL FUND
25-26 PRELIMINARY BUDGET.
SO, TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION
, A QUICK RECAP
OF THE APRIL 15th MEETING,
GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE
ECONOMIC AND SALES TAX , WHAT WE'VE
SEEN, AND THEN AN UPDATE
TO THE 25-26 BUDGET, AND THEN DISCUSS
SOME BUDGET BALANCING CONSIDERATIONS.
SO, ON THE APRIL
15th PRELIMINARY BUDGET MEETING,
IT WAS A BAD WEEK
ALL AROUND, ECONOMIC MEANS. THERE
WAS TALK
OF TARIFFS, THE STOCK MARKET WAS BOUNCING
ALL OVER THE PLACE,
WE GOT OUR SALES TAX REPORT,
THAT ESSENTIALLY HAD A
DECREASE OF $1.8 MILLION IN 24-25,
AND THEN 3.8 TOTAL
IN 25-26 REFLECTED ON THE CHART.
THIS IS BASED ON A DECLINE IN AUTO
SALES, AUTO SALES FOR THE CITY'S
41% OF ALL SALES TAX LAST YEAR. A
DECLINE IN AUTO SALES IS A
BIG THING FOR US. AND AS I
MENTIONED, THERE WAS AN OVERALL SOFTENING
IN ALL SECTORS IN
SALES TAX, AND ALSO ALL REVENUE
SOURCES AT THE TIME. SO,
IT'S NOT A RECESSION, BUT
A REFLECTION OF UNCERTAINTY THAT
MAY AFFECT OTHER REVENUE SOURCES.
THAT WAS THE MESSAGE WE GAVE, AND
A BIG ONE WAS THE
CONCERN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE FEDERAL TARIFFS.
A LOT OF THOSE ARE STILL PERSISTING,
WE DON'T KNOW, BUT,
THE INFORMATION
AND THE SALES TAX NUMBERS WE HAVE
GOTTEN SINCE THEN HAVE BEEN POSITIVE.
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR
DIRECTION TO LOOK
AT THE COST CUTTING, AND OR REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS.
I'M SORRY.
YOU DIRECTED US TO LOOK AT COST CUTTING.
I GOT THAT BACKWARDS. SO,
ECONOMIC AND SALES TAX UPDATE,
THERE'S STILL A
HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY LEADING
TO A LOT OF VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL MARKETS,
YOU CAN'T TURN ON THE FINANCIAL NEWS
WITHOUT HEARING ONE STORY OR
ANOTHER AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS
UNCERTAINTY LEADS TO DISRUPTING BUSINESS PLANNING.
BUSINESSES JUST CAN'T PREDICT, OR
PLAN
FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
A POSITIVE
UPDATE NOW THAT THE TALKS ARE GOING FROM A RECESSION
IS GOING TO HAPPEN, NOW WE'RE HEARING
RECESSION IS NOT IMMINENT. THE RHETORIC
AND TONE HAVE CHANGED TOWARD
THE POSITIVE IN THAT REGARD.
FROM OUR CONSULTANTS AND WHAT WE'RE
HEARING FROM THE NEWS,
THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE GREATER CLARITY
BY THE FOURTH
QUARTER OF 2025, THAT'S THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 2025.
HOPE IS AND THE THOUGHT IS THE EFFECTS OF TARIFFS,
AND EVERYTHING ELSE,
WHETHER OR NOT
THE FED IS GOING TO TAKE ACTION SHOULD START
, SHOULD BE ABLE TO START TO SEE THOSE
HAPPEN OR
NOT BY THE FOURTH QUARTER.
THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL, A NEWS STORY
THAT CAME OUT THAT GOT A LOT OF NEWS
SHORTLY AFTER WE MET ABOUT
GAS PRICES POTENTIALLY REACHING
$8.44 A GALLON IN 2026,
WE WERE AWARE THAT GAS PRICES COULD
GO UP, IN CALIFORNIA,
COINCIDENTALLY AT THE SAME TIME I GUESS,
SO, HDL THINKS
SIX DOLLARS A GALLON IS
A REALITY FOR GASOLINE.
FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT, FOR THE CITY,
IT HAS A LIMITED IMPACT. WE
DON'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON FUEL,
THE MAJORITY OF OUR FUEL IS FOR POLICE
SERVICES, THE MAJORITY
OF STAFF FOR NONPOLICE VEHICLES ARE EITHER
EV'S, ELECTRIC, OR
EXTENDED RANGE EV, WE DON'T USE
A LOT OF GAS.
AND ANY ADDITIONAL COST THAT WE WOULD HAVE
MORE THAN OFFSET BY ANY FUEL
RELATED SALES TAX INCREASES.
AS A CONSUMER IT'S BAD YOU'RE PAYING
MORE
BUT THE CITY WILL GET MORE REVENUE
AS GAS PRICES GO UP.
SO, THAT ISN'T OF ANY REAL CONCERN.
BIGGER ISSUE IS JUST HOW IS THAT
GOING TO AFFECT INFLATION. GAS PRICES
GO UP, THE MORE COST WHEN ENERGY GOES UP,
COSTS GO UP. THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS,
THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS.
THIS WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT, IT'S SOMETHING
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH WITH
HDL TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING.
WE JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW, WE'RE
AWARE THAT
GAS PRICES ARE GONE UP AND WE'RE MONITORING IT.
ON THE REALLY POSITIVE NOTE
WE GOT OUR FIRST QUARTER SALES TAX FINAL PAYMENT IN.
IT'S QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31st, MAKE
MONTHLY
PAYMENTS AND THE THIRD MONTH THEY
TRUE UP, THAT'S FOR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
MONEY YOU'RE GETTING AND IT CAME
IN $128,000 HIGHER THAN HDL . WE DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY SEND
US THE MONEY, AND WE WORK WITH HDL
USUALLY SIX WEEKS AFTER THEY GET
ALL THE DATA, AND START ANALYZING,
WE SHOULD MEET WITH THEM AROUND THE
FIRST PART
OF JULY TO LATE JULY, SO WE'LL HAVE
A BETTER SENSE OF WHY IT WENT UP.
AT
THIS POINT WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING UPDATES
TO THE SALES TAX PROJECTIONS, THERE'S A
LOT GOING
ON, BUT THAT WAS A VERY GOOD THING TO SEE.
WE'RE HAPPY ON THAT FRONT. SO,
NOW BUDGET UPDATES, CHANGES WE ARE REQUESTING,
THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE
WE MET ON APRIL 15th.
APRIL 15th
WE MENTIONED
THAT WE WERE GOING OFF PRELIMINARY BUDGETS
FOR FIRE AND POLICE, WE GOT THERE
FINAL
BUDGETS, THE FIRE CONTRACT IS A DECREASE OF 176,000.
WE'RE SEEING LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS AND
THE COUNTY OVERHEAD COSTS AND
THE GENERAL OVERHEAD THE COUNTY CHARGES
WAS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. OUR
DISPATCH COSTS DID GO UP A LITTLE BIT AND
PROGRAM EXPENSES IS GENERAL SERVICE
AND SUPPLIES WENT UP.
OVERALL A DECREASE AND WE WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT
THEY ARE REQUESTING WE ALLOCATE $1.75 MILLION
FOR THE PURCHASE
OF TWO REPLACEMENT FIRE ENGINES, WE'VE
BEEN SETTING MONEY ASIDE FOR THIS,
THIS WILL BE FULLY FUNDED BY THE ISO
FOR VEHICLE REPLACEMENT, WE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.
THE INTERESTING PART
IS THERE'S A FOUR YEAR LEAD TIME, SO WE ARE
, WE NEED
TO ALLOCATE THE MONEY, PUT IN A PURCHASE
ORDER, PUT IT IN AND WE'LL SEE
IN FOUR YEARS. BUT, WE'RE
NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TRUCKS ANYTIME
SOON. WE ARE STARTING THE PROCESS.
AND I GUESS THAT'S A NATIONWIDE ISSUE RIGHT NOW.
ON
THE POLICE SIDE IT'S AN INCREASE OF 2000.
THAT'S HIGHER PERSONNEL COST, THERE
WAS A REDUCTION IN DISPATCH SERVICE COSTS
BUT OVERALL
IT'S AN INCREASE IN 260.
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDES
FOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH POSITIONS,
THE THREE OF THEM ARE FUNDED BY ARPA AND ONE
BY FEDERAL GRANT, AND THEN THERE'S
ALSO HAVING TO DARE PROGRAM POSITIONS.
THOSE ARE FUNDED BY
OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUNDS. WE'RE HAVING
TWO RETIREES TEACH THEIR AND THE
SETTLEMENT FUNDS WILL FUND THAT.
AND CODE ENFORCEMENT WE'RE REQUESTING
A $200,000 INCREASE AND THAT'S JUST
DUE
TO ONGOING LEGAL ISSUES AND MATTERS.
AND THAT'S IT ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE,
AND THE REVENUE SIDE
APRIL 15th MEETING WE HAD MENTIONED THAT
WE WERE GOING TO REVISIT LICENSES
PERMITS, SO WE ARE REQUESTING A DECREASE OF
, THAT'S JUST BASED ON CURRENT YEAR TRENDS
WE PERCEIVE GOING INTO NEXT YEAR.
AND TRANS OCCUPANCY TAX,
WE'RE REQUESTING A
DECREASE OF 100,000, AND THAT'S FROM
1.5 MILLION TO 1.4, IN THE LAST
MONTH THE RECEIPTS
WE WERE SEEING WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER
AGAIN, IT'S MOVING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, WE'RE HAPPY
WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING BUT WE'RE STILL
LOWER THAN
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED, WE'RE REQUESTING
WE DECREASE BY 100,000, I SHOULD SAY.
AND THIS IS JUST KIND OF A SUMMARY,
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT CIP, THAT'S
THE TRANSFER OUTS ON THE NEXT ITEM. BUT
HAVE A VERY HEALTHY OPERATING SURPLUS
, JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT, THAT
STILL HAVE A SURPLUS
AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ALL THOSE CHANGES
I JUST DESCRIBED IS 503 THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND.
SOMETHING THAT WE DID NOT INCLUDE
BUT WE WOULD LIKE YOUR DIRECTION ON,
THAT MAY 22nd, THE CITY AND THE
UNIFIED SCHOOL LIAISON MEETING , THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT REQUESTED CITY FUND
ADDITIONAL CROSSING GUARD POSITIONS
AT APPROXIMATELY $23,000 PER POSITION.
STAFF BELIEVES THIS IS A REASONABLE
REQUEST GIVEN THE GROWTH IN THE COMMUNITY.
AND PREVIOUS MENTION THIS
HAS NOT BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE BUDGET,
AND WE'LL ASK FOR YOUR DIRECTION ON
HOW YOU
WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH THAT. AND THEN
AT THE APRIL 14th,
YOU HAD PROVIDED, GIVEN US DIRECTION TO LOOK AT
BUDGET BALANCE AND CONSIDERATIONS.
WE'VE GONE BACK AND LOOK AT POTENTIAL
COST REDUCTION IN REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS, STAFF
IS NOT RECOMMENDING ANY OF THESE ACTIONS.
WE STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE STRONG
SURPLUS POSITION. THE INFORMATION WE'RE SEEING
WITH
THE REVENUE WE GOT , CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE.
WE WANT TO PRESENT THIS,
THAT BASICALLY
WE HAVE A PLAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED SHOULD WE NEED TO.
AND SOMETHING TO THINK OF AS
WE GO OVER THIS, IF IMMEDIATE
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE NEEDED, THAT'S
USUALLY THE FIRST STEP, REVENUES COMING IN LOW,
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE FORECASTING A DEFICIT,
WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE EXPENDITURE
SIDE, THAT'S BECAUSE CITIES
ARE STRICTLY CONSTRAINED ON HOW ADDITIONAL
REVENUE CAN BE RAISED.
REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS BASICALLY NEED
VOTER APPROVAL AND WITH
VOTER APPROVAL THAT TAKES TIME AND IS NOT GUARANTEED.
TWO ADDRESS
ANY IMMEDIATE ACTIONS WOULD HAVE TO
BE ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE AS YOU
LINE
THOSE THINGS UP MORE FOR FUTURE.
I APOLOGIZE, THAT'S A LITTLE SMALL,
BUT, WHAT'S BIG ON THE POWERPOINT.
WE WORK WITH
DEPARTMENTS ON WHAT SCALING BACK WOULD MEAN
, PARKS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES.
IT WOULD BE NOT GETTING RID OF EVENTS,
BUT, LIMITING THEM, AND DECREASING THEM.
WE HAD AN ATTACHMENT
THAT WENT INTO MORE DETAIL, BUT,
THE IMPACT ON THAT WOULD JUST BE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS
ON THE COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.
WE'VE IDENTIFIED 200 AND
$58,000 WORTH OF CUTS, THERE,
NON-DEPARTMENTAL, WE TALKED ABOUT
THE LIBRARY EARLIER, AND HOW WE FUND ADDITIONAL HOURS.
REDUCTION IN
LIBRARY HOURS WOULD BE, IF WE REDUCED
ALL OF THE CITY FUNDED
HOURS IT WOULD BE $367,000.
PUBLIC WORKS WOULD REALLY BE REDUCING MAINTENANCE
AND CONTRACT SERVICES, ESPECIALLY WITH McE.
FIELD CONDITIONS, THINGS LIKE
MOWING LESS, DOING LESS
PREVENTATIVE ON BASEBALL FIELDS AND
AND THEN, THE IMPACT WOULD BE
AN EFFECT ON THE USER GROUPS. AND YOU
MOLEST, THERE WOULD BE
ISSUES WITH CLUMPING AND DEBRIS ON THE GRASS,
YOU'D HAVE CLIPPINGS.
AND ANYTIME YOU DO FOR MAINTENANCE
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE,
COST DUE TO THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.
AND WE SPEND A LOT
ON OUR FIELDS, THAT WOULD BE
A $1.75 MILLION DECREASE. AND AGAIN,
IT'S NOT AN ALL OR NOTHING, THEY'RE
OBVIOUSLY LEVELS YOU
COULD DO TO THIS. IF IT CAME DOWN
TO THIS
WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE COSTS.
AND ON THE FINANCE SIDE, WE WOULD
COME
BACK TO YOU FOR DISCUSSION ON HOW
MUCH WE WANT TO SET ASIDE FOR
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. WE CURRENTLY
SET ASIDE 2 MILLION, WE THOUGHT
A GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE
A REDUCTION OF 750,000. BUT AGAIN,
IT'S JUST AN ARBITRARY
NUMBER THAT WE COULD TALK , HAVE THE
DISCUSSION
WITH YOU ABOUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE
IS AGING, SO ANY MONEY WE DON'T SET
ASIDE NOW WOULD AFFECT US LATER.
THAT WOULD JUST BE A ONE-TIME OR MULTIPLE TIMES
SETTING
, NOT SETTING THAT MONEY ASIDE, I SHOULD SAY.
WE WOULD RECOMMEND JUST A HIRING FREEZE.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN
IN TERMS OF REVENUE. IT DEPENDS ON THE POSITION.
CANNOT HIRE, YOU HAVE A POSITION THAT IS FULLY FUNDED
WITH DEVELOPER FEES, OR AN ADMIN POSITION
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REVENUE OFFSET,
LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE.
AND THEN TYPICALLY, WHEN YOU
DO THAT, IT'S UP TO THE CITY MANAGER
TO APPROVE HIRING OF THE POSITION.
AND THEN REDUCE TRAINING AND TRAVEL
WOULD BE ONE, WE
SPENT 400,000 THEY ARE, THAT WOULD
FOR NON-MANDATED OR THIRD-PARTY FUNDED TRAVEL. BUT,
THAT WOULD DECREASE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
YOU'RE NOT PART OF WORKING GROUPS,
SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT YOU IN WAYS
DON'T KNOW, AND IT CAN LEAD TO LOWER
QUALITY OF WORK OVERTIME.
SO, TAKING ALL OF THOSE INTO
CONSIDERATION, IT'S $3.5 MILLION.
AND AGAIN, THOSE AREN'T ALL OR NOTHING,
THOSE ARE JUST, IF YOU DID ALL OF
THOSE ALL AT ONCE, THAT'S HOW
MUCH WE WOULD SAVE. ON THE REVENUE
SIDE, THE CITY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE
, BIG PICTURE, OUR FEES AND TAXES.
PROP 218 BASICALLY SAYS FEES CAN ONLY
BE SET AT
LEVELS TO RECOVER COST. WHAT THAT
MEANS IS THEY CAN'T
BE ARBITRARILY INCREASED UNLESS YOU
HAVE
AN INCREASE IN YOUR COST, OR THE FEE WAS PREVIOUSLY SUBSIDIZED.
WE DON'T SUBSIDIZE A LOT OF FEES BUT
THERE ARE SOME SUBSIDIES TO
THE TUNE OF 256,000 , THOSE ARE FEES THAT
AREN'T MANDATED BY
STATE LAW AT A CERTAIN LEVEL, THESE
ARE SIMPLY FEES WE
HAVE CHOSEN TO SUBSIDIZE, AND THOSE
ARE FOR BUSINESS LICENSE FEES, AND ALSO,
THE REMAINING ARE IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AND PERMIT FEES, AND THOSE
TYPICALLY HAVE TO DO WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY.
THEY'RE USUALLY
THE LOWER LEVEL FEES, YOU DON'T WANT
TO CHARGE SOMEONE $300 FOR A $500 PERMIT
BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T BECOME COST EFFECTIVE AND
THEY DON'T PULL THE PERMIT AND
THAT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS.
AND THEN, BESIDES THE FEE SUBSIDY,
THE BIGGER ISSUES WE WOULD BRING BACK
OUR TAX INCREASES. THE TWO WE LOOKED AT IS
TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX, TOT,
OUR RATE IS CURRENTLY 8%, IT HAS
BEEN 8% SINCE THE CITY'S INCEPTION.
THE REASON WHY THESE ARE POPULAR IS
IMPACTS VISITORS RATHER THAN RESIDENTS.
THE HOTELS CHARGE THEM.
THEY DON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE PAYING, THEY DON'T REALLY
LOOK AT THOSE, THEY'RE JUST CHARGED
IF YOU GO
TO A CONVENTION THEY'RE ALWAYS IN
THERE. BETWEEN 12 AND 14%.
THESE HAVE A HIGH APPROVAL
RATING IN TERMS OF PASSING, BECAUSE
IT'S SEEN AS
A TAX ON VISITORS
AND NONRESIDENTS. THE 2025-26 BUT
IT HAS $1.4 MILLION BUDGETED.
SO IF WE INCREASED IT TO 10, WE WOULD
SEE 350,000 INCREASE IT TO 12, 700,000.
THAT WAS
KIND OF A REFERENCE.
SALES TAX INCREASE, OUR
CURRENT RATE, THIS IS THE
10.25, THE CITY GETS 1%.
FOR 25-26 OUR REVENUE IS PROTECTED AT $26 MILLION.
THERE IS A STATE TAX OF
10.50%. POINT
2.5 REMAINING FOR ALL ELIGIBLE AGENCIES.
THAT'S ANYBODY
THAT OVERLAPS WITH THE CITY
OF DUBLIN, YOU CAN GET LEGISLATIVE
AND GET A WAIVER OF THIS,
THAT THERE IS A CAP
AND WE ARE .25% AWAY FROM IT.
IF WE PASS THAT
WE WILL GET X AMOUNT OF MONEY, BECAUSE PROJECTING SALES TAX
IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S
ALLOCATED PARTICULARLY VEHICLES , YOU PAY
SALES TAX ON A LARGE PURCHASE LIKE A
VEHICLE BASED ON THE CITY YOU LIVE.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE
CENTRAL VALLEY TO ESCAPE R 10.25
AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM YOUR I.D.
THEY'LL CHARGE YOU ANYWAY. BUT, JUST PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES
SAY WE THINK
ABOUT $4.5 MILLION-$6 MILLION.
AND THAT BRINGS
US TO CONNECT STEPS.
PROVIDE STAFF DIRECTION ON PRELIMINARY 25-26 BUDGET, AND
TO CONFIRM FUNDING OF THREE ADDITIONAL CROSSING GUARDS,
AND REDUCE COST
AND TO CONFIRM THAT REDUCTIONS ARE
NOT WARRANTED AT THIS TIME.
AFTER TODAY
THE FINAL BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL BE
BROUGHT BACK ON JUNE 17th FOR ADOPTION.
AND WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR
A VERY THOROUGH REPORT
. A COUPLE OF VERY
QUICK QUESTIONS, ONE, I DON'T KNOW, THE
FIRST ONE IF YOU CAN ANSWER.
I SAW A
NEWS REPORT, I THINK IT WAS TODAY,
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN YESTERDAY, THAT NATIONWIDE
AUTO SALES
WERE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN MAY, WHICH
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE IN THE
SALES TAX FIGURES WE SAW, AND WE MIGHT
NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT
YET IN DUBLIN. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF
WHETHER THAT WAS TRUE HERE
THE WAY IT WAS IN THE WEST OF THE
COUNTRY,
YET?
NOT FOR ME BUT WHEN WE TALKED
TO HDL WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING
HERE, THEY'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE
STATE OF THE NATION.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO THINK
OUR TREND WOULD HAVE BEEN
ANY DIFFERENT FROM THAT.
NOT UNFORTUNATELY,
NO.
THANK YOU. WHEN
WE TALK ABOUT REVENUES, ENHANCING REVENUES IS
ALMOST ALL VOTER APPROVAL,
AND THEN YOU
TALKED ABOUT THE FEES THAT WE SUBSIDIZE, THERE'S OTHER FEES
THAT WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THAT AREN'T
HERE, PARTICULARLY PARKS AND REC,
CORRECT? SO IF MY RECOLLECTION IS CORRECT, OUR TARGET
IS TO RECOVER 65% OF
PARK AND REC FEES, RIGHT?
IS THAT ACCURATE?
NOT EVERY
ONE OF THEM, BUT THAT'S OUR TARGET
FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.
SO, THERE WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY,
IF WE WANTED TO GO
THAT ROUTE, I'M SUPPORTIVE
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT RIGHT NOW. IF WE WANTED TO GO
DOWN THAT ROAD EVENTUALLY THERE WOULD
BE A
POTENTIAL FOR REVENUE INCREASES ,
IF WE WANTED TO GO THAT ROUTE. I'M
NOT SAYING WE WOULD, BECAUSE
THE SAME TIME THE CITY IS HURTING
BECAUSE IF WE WERE IN A RECESSION OUR
RESIDENTS WOULD BE HURTING AS WELL.
WE WOULD WANT TO NECESSARILY PUT THAT
BURDEN
ON THEM BUT THERE WOULD BE SOME AMOUNT
OF REVENUE WE COULD RECOVER FROM
PARKS, FEES OR USERS GROUPS, LITTLE
LEAGUE, THINGS LIKE THAT.
AN OPPORTUNITY BUT EVENTUALLY OFFSET SOME OF
THE McE, FOR EXAMPLE,
MOW THE LAWN A LITTLE LESS OR CONTINUE
MOW THE LAWN THE SAME WAY IF WE CHARGED
OUR SPORTS LEAGUES A LITTLE BIT MORE
COVER THOSE COSTS, THAT WOULD BE A
POSSIBILITY. TO OFFSET SOME OF THAT NEGATIVE
IMPACTS ON THE SPORTS FIELDS,
THINGS LIKE THAT. OKAY. AND
WE JUST SENT THEM , WE DON'T HAVE TO, THAT'S NOT
A 218.
THESE ARE NOT PROP 218.
WE DON'T HAVE TO, WE COULD SET THEM
OVER 100%,
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY 65%.
THEY, THEY'RE CARVED OUT BECAUSE IT'S PROVIDING A SERVICE
THAT OTHERS
CAN PROVIDE AS WELL. WE
CAN CHARGE SOME MARKET RATE.
WE COULD TECHNICALLY COLLECT OVER
BUT YOU'D
BE PRICING YOURSELF OUT.
AND THERE'S
DIMINISHING RETURN. EXACTLY.
THAT WAS IT FOR MY QUESTIONS RIGHT
NOW, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, QUESTIONS MARK
YEAH.
QUICK QUESTION, JUST FOR MY EDIFICATION,
IF YOU WANTED
TO INCREASE THE OCCUPANCY, TRANSFER
OCCUPANCY RATE, IS THAT
A VOTER INITIATIVE?
ALL OF IT IS ,
I JUST WANTED TO VERIFY
IF THAT WAS SOMETHING
THAT WOULD TAKE TIME ANYWAY, ALL THOSE REVENUE PRODUCING INITIATIVES
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE IMMEDIATE, THEY'D TAKE SOME TIME.
SO, I'M VERY INTERESTED.
REALLY IN FAVOR OF, OTHER THAN YOUR PROPOSAL,
BUT
CUTTING ADDITIONAL COSTS AT THIS TIME,
I LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO SOME
OF THE SPEAKERS AND I THINK
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS
TODAY MADE A MISSTATEMENT IN THAT
OUR RESERVES WOULD BE DEPLETED AFTER
A CERTAIN
POINT IN TIME. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY
NOT THE CASE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
POTENTIAL DEFICITS. WE ARE EXTREMELY STRONG
AND OUR RESERVES
ARE VERY, VERY LARGE, AND
CAN WITHSTAND A LOT OF THIS. SO,
PUTTING THAT INTO CONTEXT HERE FROM
THE OPERATING
STANDPOINT, I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF YOUR PROPOSALS,
POTENTIAL,
AND WHILE I DON'T SEE A
REAL NEED, I APPRECIATE LOOKING INTO
WHAT
WE CAN DO. BUT,
I LOOK AT JUST
FREEZING, HIRING, SOME OF THE THINGS RANDOMLY, AND THOUGHT,
I'D ASK YOU, AT WHAT POINT
IN TIME WOULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER
DOING THINGS LIKE THAT? WE'VE THROWN
THESE UP HERE AS POTENTIAL COST CUTS,
HOW REALISTIC ARE THEY WITHIN THE NEXT
THREE TO FIVE YEARS?
YOU MIGHT MESS AROUND WITH THE LIBRARY
HERE AND THERE, AND THAT'S
NOT DRACONIAN, EITHER, AS I CAN SEE
FROM YOUR ANALYSIS. BUT,
WHICH OF THESE, ON THIS LIST, WOULD BE MORE
PALATABLE TO PHASE IN , A
PRIORITY IN ANY OF THIS?
I'LL JUMP IN.
SO, THIS LIST
IS SORT OF A STANDARD LIST , THAT MOST
COMMUNITIES
WOULD LOOK AT THESE GENERAL CATEGORIES
WHEN THEY ARE FACED WITH A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT
OR COMING RECESSION. IT'S
ALWAYS GOING TO BE
PARKS, IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MAINTENANCE. IT'S
GOING TO BE
EVENTS. AND THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF AREAS WHERE
WE DO THINGS
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY THAT WE COULD
TAP INTO, THIS PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE,
WE HAVEN'T YET DONE OUR FULL ANALYSIS
OF THE
HEALTH OF OUR INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS, THEY'RE VERY HEALTHY.
WE HAVEN'T SAID, WELL, WE NEED EXACTLY THIS
MUCH MONEY FOR EXACTLY ALL
OF THESE ASSETS. SO, WE JUST KNOW
THAT IT'S
VERY HEALTHY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING
2 MILLION A YEAR INTO IT.
THAT WOULD BE
ONE PLACE THAT IMMEDIATELY,
THE COUNCIL SAID WE DON'T WANT TO
CUT ANY SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY, WE
WANT
TO MAINTAIN ALL OF OUR EVENTS THE
WAY THEY ARE, AND WE WANT OUR FIELDS
TO BE PRISTINE AND ALL THIS,
WE MIGHT LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE A YEAR
OFF OF THIS PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE CONTRIBUTION,
KNOWING THAT THE RESERVE IS VERY
HEALTHY IN THAT FUND.
THIS LIST SHOULD BE VIEWED AS SOMETHING
IN OUR BACK POCKETS ALWAYS, THAT WE
COULD ALWAYS TAP INTO,
IF REALLY NEEDED. BUT, YOU BRING
UP A GOOD POINT. WE HAVE
SO MANY RESERVES THAT WE CAN ALSO
USE AS A BRIDGE. ALSO
CAREFUL TO
NOT DEPLETE THOSE, BUT, I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE THAT
IF IT WAS ARMAGEDDON
AND EVERYTHING STOPPED, WE COULD STILL
OPERATE FOR A YEAR.
WITH NO MONEY COMING IN.
WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION THAN A
LOT OF COMMUNITIES.
WE HAVE AN OPERATING SURPLUS OF $17
MILLION. YOU ASKED WHEN WOULD WE CONSIDER
ANY OF THESE THINGS.
IN THE NEXT YEAR IF SALES TAX LOOKS
REALLY
BAD, I'LL PROBABLY COME BACK WITH
SOME RECOMMENDATION. TO JUST
MAKE SOME SORT OF A ONE-TIME CUT,
WE'LL LOOK AT THIS LIST BUT
I'LL LIKELY LOOK AT PLACES LIKE THE
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE. MAYBE I
WOULD
RECOMMEND USING A YEAR OF OUR ECONOMIC
, OUR DISASTER RESERVE, WE HAVE 8 MILLION IN THAT.
IT WOULD BE A BRIDGE FOR ME
UNTIL WE REALLY FACE
A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT, AND WE WOULD
WANT TO BE THREE YEARS
PREPARED FOR THAT EVENTUALITY.
I DO WANT TO MAKE THAT,
OUR OBJECTIVE IS SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY.
AS YOU POINTED
OUT, THAT SOME OF THESE CUTS
WOULD IMPACT THOSE SERVICES AND BE VERY NOTICEABLE.
SO, I THINK WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE
THAT WE DO HAVE VERY STRONG RESERVES,
AND WE HAVE CASH FLOW, POSITIVE.
THAT WE CAN SUPPORT THOSE SERVICES.
I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE
THINK THESE ARE QUITE MODEST CHANGES
THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.
BUT, THAT'S
FOR A DIFFERENT TOPIC. ANYWAY.
I WANTED CLARIFICATION ON THE STAGES,
WHEN YOU MIGHT
IMPLEMENT, AND I THINK
LET ME ADD ONE MORE THING.
THINK I MENTIONED THIS BEFORE, WHEN WE
HEARD ABOUT THIS SALES TAX,
I CHANGED MY BUDGET PROPOSAL
THAT WAS GOING TO COME BEFORE YOU,
BECAUSE I ORIGINALLY
HAD FOUR STAFF ADDED.
TO CONTINUE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE WE PROVIDE TODAY.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIVE, FOUR OR FIVE.
AND ULTIMATELY I CAME BACK WITH TWO.
THAT'S ALREADY IN ACTION, THAT I TOOK THAT
NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT AND YOU DON'T SEE,
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,
TO NEED THOSE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE
ONGOING SERVICE LEVEL, WE'VE ALREADY
SAID LET'S
SAID LET'S PAUSE ON THIS AND SEE HOW
THE REST OF THE YEAR GOES.
I APPRECIATE YOUR
PROACTIVE STRATEGY ON THIS, THAT'S
REALLY WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW. I'M GOOD
WITH WHAT I
SEE, HERE. THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. IF YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR BUDGET UPDATE SLIDE NUMBER FOUR,
CAN YOU
WALK ME THROUGH THE TOP TWO LINES, THE DELTA,
ROUGHLY 200 AND 300,000
ACCOUNTING FOR THAT HALF $1 MILLION DECREASE.
JUST A LITTLE MORE DETAIL
AND CONTEXT TO THAT.
THERE WE GO, YES.
ON THE REVENUE SIDE WILL BE THE
$100,000 FOR THE TOT THAT
WERE ASKING A DECREASE FROM 1.5 TO
1.4, BASED ON CURRENT YEAR TRENDS.
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO IN THE LICENSES
FINES, THAT'S THE ONE 19. THAT WE'RE
ASKING FOR. A DECREASE.
AND ON THE EXPENDITURES, WE'RE HAVING SAVINGS
ON THE FIRESIDE OF THE 176.
AND AN INCREASE IN POLICE WHICH IS
260 AND 200,000 FOR THE CODE ENFORCEMENT.
GOT IT, OKAY.
THANK YOU. FOR THAT.
AND THEN, LET'S SEE.
THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX,
IF WE WERE TO INITIATE
THAT, WHAT WITH THE TIMING LOOK LIKE?
SORRY, I'M
GOING TO JUMP IN AGAIN. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
WE WOULD WANT TO COORDINATE WITH
OUR NEIGHBORS. WHO ARE ALSO AT 8%, SO,
WHERE IS EVERYONE ELSE
IS AT 12 AROUND US, SO, THE CITY MANAGERS
HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND
GIVEN PLEASANTON SITUATION I'M SURE
THEY ARE LOOKING AT
IT, SO WE WOULD GET BACK TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
ALTOGETHER.
SO WE SHOW THIS UNITED FRONT ON THIS.
I THINK
I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW LONG IT TAKES, IT'S
LESS THAN A YEAR TO
DO IT. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
SIX AND NINE MONTHS.
OKAY,
AND YOU NEED
DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL, TO
MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT OR IS THAT MORE
DRIVEN COORDINATION ACROSS OTHER CITIES?
I WOULD PURSUE
A SCHEDULE
WITH THE OTHER CITIES.
PERFECT.
THEN, IN ONE OF YOUR SLIDES, YOU MENTIONED HAVING MORE CLARITY
IN TERMS OF THE TAX
, THE SALES TAX
BY FOURTH QUARTER OF 25. IF
WE DID SEE
A SUSTAINED DECREASE IN REVENUE, WHAT
ARE OUR OPTIONS IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL
REDUCTIONS MIDYEAR?
MIDYEAR BECOME VERY IMPORTANT AT THAT POINT.
I THINK AS COLLEEN SAID, WE HAVE
TO PUT A PACKAGE TOGETHER FOR YOU,
BUT THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE WOULD BE
FIRST OFF THE TOP BECAUSE WE
DON'T WANT TO CUT SERVICES,
WE NEED TO LOOK TO SEE, IF
THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINED, IS THIS JUST
GOING DOWN AND WITH TICKETS GOING
TO GO
UP IN THE YEAR, WE MIGHT RECOMMEND
UTILIZATION OF RESERVES, AND MAY BE
VERY
BASELINE CUTS PER DEPARTMENT.
IF I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY,
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE
BUDGET
BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. THANK YOU.
THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
THANK YOU, THAT'S AWESOME. SO,
FIRST, I DO WANT TO
REITERATE, WE HAVE
VERY HEALTHY FINANCE BUDGET, WE STILL HAVE
$16.8 MILLION
, AND WE HAVE A RESERVE OF
$200 MILLION HERE.
WE ARE NOT IN THE SAME STATE OR SITUATION
AS A LOT OF OTHER CITIES , WE ARE
LOOKING AT THE BUDGET BALANCING.
SO, WANT TO
MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WE ARE IN THE VERY POSITIVE
FINANCIAL SITUATION RIGHT NOW,
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE CITY STAFF TAKING TIME,
LOOKING INTO
ALL THOSE STRATEGIES, BECAUSE
AS JUST MENTIONED, WE WANT TO HAVE
THOSE THINGS IN MIND,
AND TO TAKE ACTIONS
IN THE FUTURE.
SO IT'S A VERY GOOD EXERCISE TO GO THROUGH THIS,
SO A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW
MUCH WE CAN DO, WHAT ITEMS WE CAN
THINK
ABOUT. THAT'S GREAT. DEFINITELY, I
INTERESTED IN THIS
TOT TAX INCREASE,
AND WORKING
TOGETHER WITH OTHER CITIES, AND ALSO
WE MENTION ONE THING ABOUT
THE SCHOOL
SUPPORT THE CROSSING GUARD, SO I WAS
IN THE LIAISON MEETING. I WANT TO GIVE
KUDOS, SHOUT OUT TO OUR CITY MANAGER COLLEEN,
BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS IMPROVED
GREATLY OVER THE PAST YEAR, AND
THEY ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE
OUR CITY MANAGER, OUR CITIES WORK PUBLICLY.
SO WE APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL.
AND FOR THE CROSSING GUARD, IT'S ABOUT
SAFETY, AND IT'S ABOUT HELPING
TO FEEL MORE RELAXED, MORE AT EASE.
AT HOME, WHERE THEY KNOW THEIR CHILDREN
ARE IN SAFE HANDS, AND ALSO
THE TOTAL COST. I THINK IT'S $60,000.
TOTAL COST.
JUST UNDER 70, RIGHT?
TOTAL COST, 69. SO I
WOULD LIKE TO SAY,
OUR CITY COUNCIL NUMBERS ALSO, I WANT
TO HEAR FROM YOU, BUT I'M
SUPPORTING THIS CROSSING GUARD. SO,
THOSE ARE THE
THINGS I WANT TO SAY. AND FOR OTHER EVENTS,
WE KNOW WE TALK ABOUT
THE FUTURE SERVICES, IF
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY WE'LL CONSIDER
OTHER THINGS
WE CAN SAY FROM THOSE THINGS, INCLUDING
CUTTING THE GRASS ,
AND ALL THOSE THINGS.
BUT, I DON'T THINK
WE NEED AS OF THIS MOMENT. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
PUBLIC COMMENT?
WE WANT TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS.
HAVE NO SPEAKER SLIPS ON
SO NOW, LET'S COME BACK
TO ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
FROM ANY OF YOU.
WANT TO ECHO YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE
SCHOOL
CROSSING GUARDS, I APPRECIATE OUR
LIAISON COMMITTEE
WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE COOPERATION,
NOT ONLY ON THIS ITEM
AND AN ITEM ON CONSENT WITH
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HAVE
THE SALE OF THE SITE,
FOR SHAMROCK HILLS ELEMENTARY,
AS MENTIONED,
AND HAD SOME VERY FAVORABLE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT
AND OUR COOPERATION WITH A PAST THAT
ITEM WITH THEIR LAST BOARD MEETING. I APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION AND
I'M IN FAVOR OF US FUNDING THOSE THREE
CROSSING GUARDS. THERE'S
A LOT OF HISTORY BEHIND
CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM NOW AND
THE NUMBER OF CROSSING GUARDS REFUND
THE THREE ADDITIONAL IS APPROPRIATE.
I ALSO IN AN AGREEMENT
THAT WE OUGHT TO GIVE HEAD NODS TO
START INVESTIGATING THE TOT INCREASE,
I THINK THERE IS A LEAD TIME
FIGURING
OUT WHEN WE PUT THAT ON THE BALLOT,
WHAT BALLOT IT MAKES SENSE TO GO
ON, DO WE WANTED ON THE PRESIDENTIAL,
ON THE MIDYEAR TO MARK DO
WE WANTED ON A SPRING BALLOT, ALL
THOSE THINGS ARE CONSIDERATIONS AND
I THINK WE
NEED TO GIVE STAFF THE DIRECTION TO
BRING IT BACK TO
US WHEN IT MAKES SENSE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE'RE DOING IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH
THE OTHER CITIES, THERE WILL BE A
LOT
OF TAX MEASURES COMING UP. WE KNOW
THAT THERE IS THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION
TAX COMING
UP, AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S
ON A BALLOT THAT
MAKES SENSE. WHERE IT HAS THE BEST
CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LEAST CHANCE
OF GETTING BURIED AND CONFUSED WITH
OTHER
THINGS, AND I THINK WORKING WITH OUR
NEIGHBORING CITIES ON THAT, AND
WITH ADVICE FROM VISIT TRI VALLEY
AS WELL IS WARRANTED.
AND I AGREE THAT WE DON'T
NEED TO MAKE ANY OF THESE OTHER CUTS
AT THIS TIME. I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WARRANTED. BUT, IF WE WERE
TO ALL OF A SUDDEN FIND OURSELVES
IN A RECESSION AND
PROPERTY TAXES WENT DOWN THE SAME
WAY SALES-TAX ARE GOING, IT'S NICE
TO KNOW
THAT WE HAVE OPTIONS AND A PLAN IN
PLACE FOR WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO
DO SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF
WHAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US. THANK
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS?
I MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR I'M SUPPORTIVE
THESE RATHER MODEST RECOMMENDATIONS.
WE ARE NOWHERE IN NEED OF
ANY OF THESE CUTS, I'M INTERESTED
IN UNDERSTANDING IN THE LONG-TERM,
YOU'D FOOT THOSE SWITCHES, I THINK
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW.
LISTING THEM IS
GOOD AND WE'RE SITTING THERE GOING, WHAT IF?
WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU MIGHT ENGAGE THEM. BUT I THINK
OUR FINANCIALS, OUR
RESERVES ARE QUITE STRONG,
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS, WE CAN
WORK THROUGH IT. WITH SOME OF THESE
PROPOSED CHANGES. I THINK YOU DID
A GREAT JOB, IT WAS GOOD ANALYSIS. I'M GOOD
WITH THIS POINT.
HOW ABOUT CROSSING GUARD? I'M
FINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS,
WHICH WAS THEIR RECOMMENDATION.
YEAH, THANKS FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER.
BASED ON OUR LAST
COUNCIL MEETING WE WERE SORT OF IN
THIS
WAIT AND SEE POSITION, I THINK IDENTIFYING
EARMARKING THESE AREAS OF
CHANGES BUDGET REDUCTIONS I THINK
IS A
GOOD INITIATIVE, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
THAT IN OUR BACK POCKET. I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO MOVE ON THAT NOW, BEING
IN THE SURPLUS
POSITION THAT WE'RE IN. WE
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, I AM CAUTIOUS AND
SO MUCH VOLATILITY HAPPENING THAT I
WANT TO
KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE TAXES, AND
REVENUE
AS WELL AS MANAGERS AND HAVING THESE
TO PROTECT
THAT SURPLUS
POSITION IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
BUT, FOR NOW I'M SUPPORTIVE OF
WHERE YOU ARE, WITH THE
THREE ADDITIONAL CROSSING GUARDS,
I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO MAKE ANY
OF THOSE COST REDUCTIONS AT
THE MOMENT AND ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF
THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TASK FORWARD.
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A MOTION?
IS THIS GUIDANCE?
I GOT --
DIRECTION, I BELIEVE I HAVE THE DIRECTION.
THANKS, EVERYONE.
LET'S MOVE TO 7.2,
FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
GENERAL FUND PROJECT
2025 TO 2026
WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE CIP
AND LOOKED AT THE GENERAL FUND , FUNDED PROJECTS.
AS I STATED,
APRIL 15th, THE PRELIMINARY CIP WAS
PROVIDED TO CITY COUNCIL,
WE RECEIVED FEEDBACK BASED ON
WHAT WAS PRESENTED BY FINANCE STAFF ON THOSE
PROJECTIONS FOR TAXES,
REVENUES, AND OTHER THINGS. WE WENT
THROUGH AND ANALYZED 39 PROJECTS THAT
WERE FUNDED EITHER FULLY
OR PARTIALLY BY GENERAL FUND. WITH
THAT, WE CATEGORIZED THOSE INTO THREE TIERS
, SO THE FIRST TIER IS PROJECTS THAT ARE
EITHER FUNDED
WITH MATCHING DOLLARS
, SO
WE BASICALLY MAXIMIZING THAT IS
THE PROJECT IS ALMOST COMPLETE
THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION
THAT WE'RE LET'S SAY
SIX MONTHS FROM DELIVERING.
THE SECOND HERE IS NO CHANGES RECOMMENDED AT
THIS TIME, HOWEVER,
IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY IN
TIER 3, WE COULD
GO BACK TO TIER 2 BUT STAFF IS NOT
RECOMMENDING AT THIS TIME.
WITH THAT, WE'LL GO THROUGH
THE TIER 1, AS I SAID, A LOT OF THESE
YOU NOTICE ARE CURRENTLY IN CONSTRUCTION REFERRED TO AS
IMPLEMENTATION
OR WILL SOON BE.
OR, THAT THERE IS GRANT MATCHING DOLLARS
FOR THIS.
THE CITY RECEIVED OVER $5 MILLION
IN A CTC
ACROSS THREE PROJECTS RECENTLY.
LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE
THOSE DOLLARS, TAKING OUR GENERAL
FUND AND
STRETCHING IT, THAT'S WHAT REPRESENTED
WITH THESE 17 PROJECTS, HERE.
GOING
TO THE TIER 2 AGAIN, NO CHANGES RECOMMENDED AT
THIS TIME, HOWEVER, THERE IS
POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY IF THE COUNCIL
SO CHOOSES, TO GO BACK, BUT,
WE'RE NOT SEEKING ANY CHANGE AT THIS
TIME OR RECOMMENDING IT.
AND THEN WE HAVE TIER 3 WHICH ARE THE POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS,
WE IDENTIFIED SIX PROJECTS,
ONE OF THEM WAS A NEW PROJECT
TO THE CIP IN THE PRELIMINARY WHICH
WAS LOOKING AT ANALYZING
WHERE SHADE COULD BE,
THE FIRST PROJECT WOULD BE AT THE WAVE,
THE NEXT WOULD BE THE
SPORTS
PARK UPGRADES, SO THIS HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS IS ON TOP OF
$150,000 OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE
. THE NEXT
WOULD BE BASICALLY A SHIFT
IN COMPLETION
THE COAL PARK RENOVATION,
SO WE LOOK TO MOVE THAT PROJECT OUT,
TO 26-27. ONE THING TO NOTE IS
THERE IS A 5% ESCALATION FOR THAT MOVE OUT,
SO THAT'S YOU SEE OUT THERE
ON THE
PROJECT CHANGE THAT THERE IS ROUGHLY ABOUT $150,000
ADDED COST FOR DELAYING THIS IMPROVEMENT. THE NEXT
WOULD BE AS THE SUNDAY
SCHOOL BARN IMPROVEMENTS AGAIN, WE
WOULD MOVE THAT
TO FUTURE, AND THEN WHEN THAT PROJECT IS BROUGHT BACK,
WE WOULD REANALYZE WHAT THE MARKET IS
AT THAT TIME, AND IF THERE WOULD NEED
BE ANY SORT OF ADJUSTMENT , WE WOULD
ADD
THAT AT THAT TIME FOR THE PROJECT. THE SAME THING
WOULD BE FOR THE STORM DRAIN, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
WE WOULD ABSORB THE INITIAL ANALYZING
THE LINES, WITHIN THE OPERATING BUDGET OF PUBLIC WORKS.
THAT $30,000 ASSESSMENT WE WOULD COVER
FOR THE OPERATING SIDE OF PUBLIC WORKS.
FINALLY IT WOULD BE THE SAN RAMON LANDSCAPING RENOVATION,
TO CLOSE THE PROJECT,
WE DIDN'T DO THOSE IMPROVEMENTS, A
LOT OF IT WAS,
PREVIOUSLY THE DROUGHT
, IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO THROUGH AND
DO THE RENOVATION OF LANDSCAPE WHEN
THEY SAID
WE WOULD LET YOU WATER ONE DAY A WEEK
OR WHATEVER. IT WASN'T
A GOOD IMAGE FOR THE CITY TO BE
REVITALIZING THE LANDSCAPE
TO BROWN YOUR LAWN.
SO WITH
ALL THOSE CHANGES POTENTIALLY, ROUGHLY $1.4 MILLION
OR DEFERMENT.
SO WITH THAT IS
HAPPY
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ,
AND TO
BE BACK IN TWO WEEKS WITH THE UPDATED CIP.
THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT, DO YOU
MIND GOING BACK
TO THE SLIDE THAT SHOWS THE PROJECTS
YOU MARK CAN YOU POP BACK TO
2.2 FOR A QUESTION?
THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY IN PROGRESS?
THEY'RE IN VARIOUS STAGES.
SOME OF THEM MAY NOT HAVE STARTED
OR THEY'RE SLATED TO START THIS YEAR.
THE SIT CAMS, THOSE ARE PROBABLY
WHAT IS THE CHIEF SAY, 80% OF THE WAY THROUGH EXPENDITURE?
THE AV SYSTEM UPGRADE, THAT IS ONGOING.
WE'RE CURRENTLY REVITALIZING
THE CONFERENCE ROOMS,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH
OF THEM. I JUST WANTED TO GET A FEEL
FOR WHY THEY'RE
TIER 2 IN GENERAL AS OPPOSED TO
WHAT WAS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TIER
AND TIER 3?
THESE ARE ALL PROJECTS
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO,
WHETHER IT'S TO KEEP UP THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE,
OR WE'RE GOING TO
NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES,
OR POTENTIALLY
IT MAY COST MORE IF WE DON'T DO THIS.
ON AN ADDED
MAINTENANCE COST.
WOULD YOU POP
DOWN TO TIER 3, NOW? THANK YOU.
ON THE COAL PARK RENOVATION,
WE DO FEEL WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO
DO THAT,
IN THE FUTURE. AND IT WOULD COST MORE TO DEFER IT.
AT LEAST SOMEWHAT MORE,
BUT YOU DIDN'T FEEL
IT WAS TIER 2, YET SOME OF THE TIER
2 WE KNOW IT WOULD COST MORE TO DO FOR THEM. SO,
YOU SEE
WHAT I'M GETTING AT A LITTLE BIT.
IS A LOT OF THE RENOVATION PORTIONS
THAT IT'S TIRED.
WHEREAS IF WE GO BACK
TO THE PARK PLAYGROUND REPLACEMENT.
THAT'S GETTING TO THE POINT
WHERE, IT'S UNSAFE, OR WE NEED
TO COME UP TO TODAY'S STANDARDS TYPE OF THINGS.
THAT'S A VARIATION WITHIN A PARK.
I ALMOST HATE TO ASK THIS QUESTION
AND OPENED THIS CAN OF WORMS
BUT THE MARQUEE SIGNS,
ONE OF THEM IS WHEN WE WANT TO PUT
IN ON THE
EAST SIDE OF TOWN, IS
THERE ANY KIND OF URGENCY ON THOSE?
IT'S NOT ON THE TIER
3 LIST. EXISTING ONES,
THEY'RE NOT UNSAFE ,
THAT IS CORRECT.
THERE'S TWO REPLACEMENTS, THAT IS
FOR SENIOR AND SHANNON.
THEN THERE'S TWO ADS, ONE FOR
HERE, AND ONE AT
TWO. OKAY.
AND WE DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S A CANDIDATE
FOR DEFERRAL WHY?
THE TWO REPLACEMENTS
ARE THE REASON WHY IT'S SITTING AT TIER 2.
GETTING IT PASSED THERE, USEFUL LIFE.
AND IF THEY WENT DARK, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
THAT COMMUNICATION TO THE FOLKS OF
AT SENIOR AND OTHER THINGS
THAT WERE ADVERTISING TO THE PUBLIC.
YOU, LET'S GO BACK TO TIER 3. THE COAL PARK RENOVATION
WOULD COST US MORE TO DEFER
, BUT THESE OTHERS WE DON'T THINK
WOULD COST
US MORE IF WE DEFERRED THEM EVENTUALLY?
OR
IF WE DON'T DO THEM AT ALL?
THAT IS THE POTENTIAL.
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
BARN A LITTLE BIT
MORE. MY RECOLLECTION IS THIS IS BECAUSE
THE FLOOR
CANNOT HANDLE THE TRAFFIC THAT IT
HAS NOW.
CORRECT. STRUCTURALLY, THE
UNDERPINNING IS NEW
WHEN THE BARN WAS RELOCATED.
IT'S JUST THAT THE WEARING SERVICE
THAT IS THAT HISTORIC, SO
THAT'S THE PART THAT WE NEED TO UPGRADE.
OR PRESERVE IN
SOME WAY.
SO IF WE CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT,
WE MAY HAVE TO PUT LIMITATIONS
ON WHAT CAN WE PUT
ON THAT FLOOR SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE
A HIGH POINT LOAD
CAUSE A POTENTIAL HOLE IN THE FLOOR.
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO AS
OFTEN AS WE DO OR AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE DO,
SOME PARTICULAR RENTALS MAY
BE LIMITED.
THERE WOULD BE
A COST TO THE COMMUNITY
FOR US DEFERRING THAT. AND THEN ON
TO GO BACK TO THAT ONE A LITTLE BIT,
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER.
WOULD THERE BE
A POSSIBILITY OF PICKING AND CHOOSING
PARTS OF THAT CIP TO DEFER? NOT ALL
OF IT?
YES. WE CAN GO BACK
AND REANALYZE WHAT IS
THE BEST USE
OF FUNDS AT THIS POINT.
THE RESTROOM IS ONE OF THE ITEMS WE
KNOW THE PLAY STRUCTURES,
ONE OF THOSE CAN WE GO THROUGH
AND ANALYZE OR DETERMINE , CAN WE SAVE
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF LANDSCAPING?
PART OF IT IS, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING? AM I TEARING IT OUT TO DO THOSE
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS YOU MARK YOU MAY
PAY FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT.
AND THE SAN RAMON LANDSCAPE
RENOVATION, THAT NUMBER IS NOT HARD
AND FAST ANYWAY, CORRECT?
THE 239 IS A BIT OF A GUESS? YES?
THAT IS A NUMBER FROM
EIGHT, 10 YEARS AGO.
IF WE DID THAT PROJECT THAT NUMBER
WOULD GO
UP SIGNIFICANTLY, RIGHT?
MOST LIKELY.
IF WE DEFER IT, MEANING WE SAY
WE'RE GOING TO
A LIMIT THAT PROJECT, WHAT WOULD BE OUR
PLAN EVER FOR THE LANDSCAPING?
IT IS LOOKING PRETTY TIRED AND DATED.
WE CAN LOOK TO POTENTIALLY
DO IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH MAINTENANCE
OVER
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. CHANGING OUT CERTAIN PLANS,
LIKE FIVE TO 10% PER YEAR,
AND JUST
ABSORB IT WITH MAINTENANCE AS AN OPTION.
THE OTHER IS WE COULD POTENTIALLY
LOOK TO CHANGE THIS
TO A BABY FRIENDLY AND THERE MAY
BE OTHER GRANT OPPORTUNITIES. JUST
LOOKING AT WHAT
THE PALLET IS, AND HOW WE IRRIGATE
IT, THERE
MAY BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
TO GET MATCHING DOLLARS FOR IT, TO
HELP OFFSET THAT.
THAT'S THE EXTENT OF MY QUESTIONS
FOR NOW.
I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY WHEN WE GET
TO DELIBERATION.
QUESTIONS? YEAH. TIER 3,
GOT THAT RIGHT THERE. A COUPLE OF THINGS.
SPORTS PARK, FOR EXAMPLE,
I WAS LOOKING AT THAT NUMBER, I'M GOING
BACK UP A STEP. WE'VE BEEN USING THE
WORD DEFER OR ELIMINATE, IT'S EITHER ONE.
WITH REDUCED,
ELIMINATE, OR DEFER. WHAT ARE WE
TRYING TO DO HERE? WE HAVE OPTIONS,
RIGHT?
ELIMINATE IS THE SAN RAMON LANDSCAPE THAT
WOULD BE OFF
THE BOOKS. THE DIFFERING IS WHERE
WE'RE GOING TO PUSH THAT OUT.
LET'S SAY THE SHADE STRUCTURE, THAT
WAS A NEW PROJECT THAT
CAME TO COUNCIL, THAT HAS NOT BEEN
ADDED TO THE BOOK.
THAT WAS AN ASK. SO, WE COULD LOOK
TO PUT
IT IN AS A FUTURE PROJECT OR
JUST AS AN OPTION ,
WE KNOW THERE'S OTHER PRIORITIES IS
NOT WORTH PUTTING IN.
WE COULD GO AS FUTURE YEAR, IT COULD
GO OUT INTO
THE FIFTH YEAR. AS A PLANNING TOOL,
AND WE CAN REFINE THAT NUMBER
AS WE BRING IT TO COUNCIL FOR ACTION.
I WILL SPEAK IN TERMS OF
REDUCTION FIRST.
HAVE WE DONE ANALYSIS
ON THESE SHADE STRUCTURES IN TERMS OF
OTHER OPTIONS ?
IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER.
YOU CAN SAY YES, NO,
WHATEVER. DO WE HAVE OTHER OPTIONS
MIGHT REDUCE THAT AMOUNT?
THE INITIAL
SEED MONEY TO GO THROUGH , THE SURVEY
OF WHERE DO WE NEED
SHADE, HOW MUCH SHADE,
WHAT IS THE COST OF EACH OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS
AT THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS. THAT'S NOT EVEN THE COST
TO CONSTRUCT THE SHADE.
OKAY. OH.
THAT'S JUST A PLANNING NUMBER.
SO THERE'S SOME LEEWAY THERE, I'M SURE.
FALLON SPORTS PARK, HAVE 1 MILLION BUCKS.
I THINK ONE OF THE CRITICAL THINGS, WE ALL
KNOW A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS ARE, THERE
ARE HIGHER PRIORITY NEEDS
FOR THAT, AND OTHERS,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE NUMBER. I'M JUST WONDERING,
WE'RE ADDRESSING
THE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY NEEDS
, I KNOW ONE OF
THOSE NEEDS, WE'RE STARTING TO DO, WE
GOT THE FLAG, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT
THERE.
ONE OF THE ASKS WAS FOR THE MESH NETTING AROUND
CALLED IT NETTING BUT AROUND , AND THAT'S
INCLUDED IN
THE MONEY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN
THERE NOW, OR IS THAT
IN THE 500 GRAM? THAT'S IN THE 150. OKAY.
SO, THERE'S SOME POTENTIAL HERE, I WOULD THINK,
TO REDUCE THAT NUMBER.
I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT DEFERRING, I'M JUST THINKING
THE BIG THING
SEEDING UPGRADES, AND TRYING
TO BUILD ENOUGH ROOM TO DO
TRUE STADIUM SEATING.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW THE ULTIMATE VISION IS
THIS FACILITY ATTRACTS HIGHER-LEVEL USAGE.
IT'S A DIFFERENT FACILITY THAN OUR
OTHER BASEBALL FIELDS.
SO, THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT LEVEL
OF SEEDING IS ACCEPTABLE?
SO CERTAINLY THERE'S MOVEMENT THERE,
THAT WAS THE BULK
OF IT. I BELIEVE A SCOREBOARD IS IN THAT NUMBER,
AND,
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT ELSE WAS IN.
TOPSFIELD PADDING AND THE WI-FI.
EA.
THOSE ARE SMALLER THINGS,
WHEN WE PUT
THIS NUMBER IN TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT
SEEDING. THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS.
I'LL MODIFY THAT TO DEFER.
I KNOW LIKE NOW,
I KNOW WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS
ON THESE. CAN WE BRING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS,
I WANTED TO CONTINUE
WITH THIS. I DON'T THINK I'M MAKING
, I'M GETTING CLARIFICATION
ON SOME OF THESE THINGS, HERE.
I'M NOT SETTING THE NUMBER, IF YOU
PERMIT ME TO
CONTINUE I'D APPRECIATE THAT.
ON THE COLD PARK, THE RENOVATION GETTING
BACK TO THAT, WHEN YOU SAID
AN ESCALATION
, IS THAT, HOW DOES THAT TRIGGER?
FOR CONSTRUCTION. YES.
THERE'S THE POTENTIAL TO SPLIT APART
AS COUNCILMEMBER JOSEY MENTIONED,
LOOK AT THAT, TOO. AND
THE OTHER ONES, I THINK SHE'S ADDRESSED
IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY MEAN IN TIMING.
BUT, I'D LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
GO THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE, AND
IDENTIFY
EITHER CUTS OR DEFERRALS.
THAT'S THE EXTENT OF
MY CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I'VE GOT THREE QUESTIONS
, ALL PERTAINING TO TIER 2.
THE FIRST ONE IS TRYING TO
GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON CONDITION ASSESSMENT
OF THE WATER FEATURES.
THAT IS, AT
CIVIC, THE FOUNTAIN BY THE FLAGPOLES,
AND WE
HAVE THE GLOBE IN THE CENTER OF THE
COURTYARD. THOSE ARE ALL ORIGINAL
1989 WHEN WE OPEN THIS FACILITY,
NEEDED TO GO THROUGH, ASSESS THE CONDITION,
SEE WHAT IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO
BE DONE.
SO, THE 50 K PLACEHOLDER IS JUST EVALUATION.
SECOND ONE IS THE DOWNTOWN
DUBLIN TOWNSQUARE PARK.
AND I CAN'T
FIND THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME, BUT,
COULD YOU ADD A LITTLE CLARITY , JUST
OVER 100 K?
THAT'S KIND OF SEED MONEY FOR THE CITY TO
WORK WITH THE DEVELOPERS,
AS PART OF DOWNTOWN. THERE'S THE VISION
OF THAT TOWNSQUARE
YOUR CENTRAL FOCUS POINT,
WHEN YOU COME IN. SO, THAT'S FOR ALL
OF US TO PROVIDE INITIAL PRELIMINARY DESIGN,
WORK WITH THE APPLICANT
COME UP WITH A DESIGN FOR IMPLEMENTATION.
GOT
IT, OKAY. AND THEN THE THIRD ONE WAS
THE RESTROOM REPLACEMENT.
MILLION DOLLARS, THERE, COULD YOU
WALK ME THROUGH THAT?
THAT IS TO REPLACE TWO RESTROOMS,
THAT'S A WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT. ONE IS
AT ALAMO, THE OTHER IS
AND, MABEL.
SORRY?
GOT IT. OKAY.
YEAH,
I THINK THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS
FOR NOW, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU,
YOU FOR THIS COMPREHENSIVE LIST, AND ALSO
FOR THE
DIFFERENT TIERS ON THAT.
WHAT ARE THE PRODUCTS AND HOW
YOU THINK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE, OR
WHAT'S
THE IMPACT OF THOSE THINGS? I LOOK AT THE SPREADSHEET,
THE ATTACHMENT, I THINK THE LAST ATTACHMENT,
SO MY QUESTION IS,
FOR THE DIFFERENT YEARS, GENERAL
FUND ONLY COST, 25-26, IS TOTAL
$16 MILLION.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? THIS
ATTACHMENT ONE. OKAY.
BASICALLY BE ASKED FOR
FUNDING, WHETHER IT WAS
PLANNED PREVIOUSLY IN THE CIP
AND FORWARD ONE YEAR, OR ADJUSTMENTS
THOSE ARE ALL OF THE GENERAL FUND FUNDING
FOR THESE PARTICULAR PROJECTS.
SO, MY QUESTION IS, FOR THIS YEAR,
60 MILLION, NEXT YEAR 2 MILLION, A YEAR
AFTER
IS 1.8 MILLION. SO, SEEMS LIKE
THE NUMBER REDUCED DRAMATICALLY OVER YEARS.
WILL THIS BE THE CASE, OR NEXT YEAR
WHEN IT'S NEXT
YEAR, WE'LL SEE A BIG NUMBER AGAIN?
TO SEND MONEY THERE AGAIN.
POTENTIALLY, AS WE DO THE CIP EVERY TWO YEARS,
IS THE UPDATE YEAR, NEXT YEAR WILL
BE BASICALLY BE OPEN
THE PROJECT AND DO A CALL FOR
PROJECTS, THAT'S WHEN WE POTENTIALLY
CAN BRING TO YOU
OTHER ITEMS FOR CONSIDERATION.
THAT'S HOW YOU CAN GET MORE DOLLARS NEXT YEAR.
SO THAT'S
MY QUESTIONS, SO WE'RE OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
MAYOR, I HAVE TWO SPEAKERS NOTES
ON THIS ITEM. THE
FIRST ONE IS TRACY BARNETT.
COUNCIL NUMBERS AND STAFF,
CEO OF VISIT TRI-VALLEY, YOUR DESTINATION AGENCY
FOR THE CITY OF DUBLIN, PLEASANTON,
LIVERMORE, AND THE TOWN OF DANVILLE.
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN MY COMMENTS THIS
EVENING
WITH A LITTLE STORY. SO VISUALIZE, IF YOU WILL.
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE THERE
IS A FAMILY OF FOUR
COMING TO DUBLIN'S NEW MULTI USE EVENT
CENTER. ON A FRIDAY NIGHT
FOR THEIR DAUGHTER LEO'S REGIONAL VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT.
CHECK IN AT THE HYATT PLACE, NICE
AND CLOSE BY, THEY GRAB SOME DINNER
THE LAZY DOG AND THEY GET READY FOR THE
EARLY-MORNING MATCH. THEY SCOPE OUT
THE REGAL THEATER FOR THE NEW MINECRAFT
MOVIE, JUST IN CASE.
SATURDAY MORNING,
MOM, DAD, BROTHER JASON ARE WATCHING
THE MATCH AT 9:00 A.M. AND THE TEAM
ADVANCES TO THE NEXT ROUND. SO THEY
ARE TO RETURN AT 4:00 P.M. FOR GAME
NUMBER TWO. AND THEY'VE HAD SOME TIME TO
CHECK OUT THE AREA.
SO FIRST THEY FIND THE FABULOUS RESTAURANT FOR
LUNCH,
IT'S A FAMILY FAVORITE.
THEN THEY TAKE JASON, A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD
TO WORK OUT SOME ENERGY
OF THE IMAGINE PLAYGROUND. AFTER A
QUICK REFRESH BACK AT THE
HOTEL THEY POPPED INTO VITALITY BALLS,
FOR DRINKS AND SNACKS. GAME
TWO IS A TIGHT MATCH. HER LAST GAME
IS AT NOW UNTIL SUNDAY.
MOM IS A
FOODIE, SHE TAKES THE FAMILY DOWN
TO A HIGHLY RATED TRAYS,
SHE DISCOVERED ONLINE, AND YES,
THEY CATCH A MOVIE AT THE REGAL HACIENDA
CROSSING AND THE
WHOLE FAMILY IS HAPPY AND BACK TO BED THEY GO.
DAY THREE, SORRY TO SAY, ME HIS TEAM
IS BEATEN
BY PAST REGIONAL CHAMPIONS. NOT TO
WORRY, EVERYONE STICKS AROUND TO
THE VERY END FOR THE AWARDS. DAD
TAKES SON JASON TO THE DUBLIN HERITAGE
PARK BECAUSE HE'S A HISTORY BUFF.
MEANWHILE, MOM AND MIA SHOT THE
RACK AT PERSIMMON PLACE. THEY RETURNED
TO THE CENTER
FOR THE CELEBRATION, AND THEY DRIVE HOME.
THAT IS ONE FAMILY
STAYING, DINING,
DRINKING, BONDING, AND SHOPPING. THAT
WAS ONE VOLLEYBALL PLAYER.
THERE
ARE APPROXIMATELY 15 ON A TEAM, THERE
ARE TYPICALLY 100 TEAMS AT A
REGIONAL EVENT LIKE THAT ONE AND 52 WEEKENDS
THAT WE CAN BOOK THAT BUSINESS.
THEY WILL FILL THE HOTELS, THE SHOPS,
RESTAURANTS AND ATTRACTIONS
ACROSS THE ENTIRE VALLEY. THEY WILL
TO BUSINESSES BOTTOM LINES, THEY WILL
HAVE TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE, THEY
WILL PROVIDE MORE REVENUES TO THE
CITY, YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS. THIS
IS THE SPORTING EVENTS .
WE WILL ATTEMPT TO FILL THAT CENTER
WITH THE MANY DAYS OF
THE YEAR AS POSSIBLE FROM CORPORATE
COMMUNITY EVENTS, AND BIG-NAME CONCERTS, TOO.
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS, WE ARE WORKING HAND-IN-HAND
WITH YOUR STAFF SO
THANK YOU, COLLEEN, AND JEFF AND JAY
AND HAZEL AND FELICIA. WE ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS.
YOU ARE OUR PARTNERS AND AS WE CONTINUE
TO LEAD THE CHARGE ALONG WITH OUR
CONSULTANTS
AT A.L.L. DESTINATION ADVISORY,
THE GLOBAL
FORTUNE 500 COMPANY, WE VALUE YOUR
INVESTMENT IN THE MULTI USE EVENT CENTER,
AND SEE
IT COMING TO LIFE. THANK YOU.
YOU. WE
LOOK FORWARD FOR THAT.
NEXT SPEAKER IS GUY HOUSTON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM MAYOR,
COUNCIL MEMBERS, GUY HOUSTON, TONIGHT
REPRESENTING THE DOUBLE LEPRECHAUNS, ONE
OF YOUR ATTENDANCE AT THE SPORTS FIELD.
I WANTED TO PUT
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF
SOME MEAT ON THE BONES AS FAR AS THE
COST OF THE DIFFERENT
ITEMS THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS EVENING.
THE $500,000
, THAT WAS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT FROM ME,
PLACEHOLDER PUT IN THERE.
WE HAVE WHAT I'M PASSING OUT TO YOU,
THE TWO MAJOR PROJECTS TO BE DONE, WOULD BE
SEATING OUT THERE AT THE FIELD, THE
SECOND IS A SCOREBOARD,
IS A STORAGE CONTAINER
OUT THERE, WHICH WOULD BE
, ONE THERE NOW WHICH IS UTILIZED
BY
EMERALD HIGH, THE LEPRECHAUNS AND LITTLE
LEAGUE AND IF WE HAD ANOTHER ONE OUT
THERE THAT
WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY'S LIFE A LOT
EASIER. THE $500,000, YOU TALKED ABOUT REDUCTIONS, SO,
I HAVE
, MY VISION IS THAT THERE WOULD
BE STANDS OUT THERE, MUCH LIKE A LOT OF
YOUR HIGH SCHOOLS, DUBLIN HIGH BASEBALL
HAS STANDS AND BLEACHERS AT
THEIR FIELD. YOU COULD HAVE THERE'S
LOTS OF CHOICES AS YOU CAN SEE,
BUT THE ONE I SAW WAS 155 SEATS TIMES TWO,
IS $60,000 RIGHT THERE.
SECOND ITEM IS THE SCOREBOARD,
YOU CAN MAKE IT FROM VERY VERY LOW
TWO LOTS
AND LOTS, BUT THE ONE THAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU
WHICH WOULD BE A HUGE UPGRADE AND
POSSIBLY THE BEST ONE IN THE PECOS
LEAK IS $41,000 BOARD.
SO, WE ADD THOSE
TWO TOGETHER IS $100,000.
SHIPPING CONTAINER IS $15,000 WOULD YOU PUT
THE CEMENT PAD IN AND THEN GET THE CONTAINER,
THE CONTAINER IS ALMOST A FREEBIE. THEY
GIVE THOSE THINGS AWAY. THE PAD, TO PUT
THE CONTAINER ON, WOULD COST SOME MONEY. 15,000.
RIGHT NOW, WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE, OR WHAT
WE CAN MAKE THIS
REALLY A FIRST-CLASS PARK, IS $115,000
. THEIR SOFT COST
COST MORE, AS WE KNOW, AND SO,
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE 50% MARGIN, 30% MARGIN, YOU DO THE MATH.
CERTAINLY THINGS THAT ARE NOT SET
IN STONE, OBVIOUSLY. YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT WAY UNDER HALF OF WHAT THAT
$500,000 WAS.
THE 145 OR $150,000
THAT YOU ALLOCATED ALREADY, WE HAVE THE BEST
LIKE POLE AND FLAG IN THE TRI-VALLEY RIGHT NOW.
SO IT'S SOMETHING TO BE
PROUD OF, NOT JUST BY OUR BASEBALL
TEAM. YOU HAVE A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM,
KUDOS TO STAFF FOR GETTING THAT DONE
AND PUT TOGETHER, FANTASTIC.
THE GREEN MESH HAS
NOT APPEARED YET. THAT IS WITHIN THAT
HUNDRED 50,000, HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET.
THE NEXT THING IS THE WI-FI,
WHICH WAS IN THE $150,000
MIGHT BE CURIOUS AS TO HOW MUCH YOU
ACTUALLY SPENT SO FAR.
AND OF THE FLAG WAS
MORE THAN WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD
COST BUT IT WAS A $150,000. ALL
I'M SAYING IS THAT, WE CAN MAKE THIS
A REAL REGIONAL ATTRACTION,
AND IT IS
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBLE LEPRECHAUNS,
BUT IT'S ALSO THE BENEFIT OF EMERALD HIGH SCHOOL.
SO FAR THIS SEASON, THANKS TO YOU, WE
RAISED OUR LEVEL SO MUCH HIGHER
THAN WERE IN OUR PREVIOUS TWO
SEASONS, THE COMMUNITY, WE HAVE
EVENTS COMING UP WITH TRI-VALLEY
ROTARY, WE HAVE DOUBLED HISTORICAL,
WE HAVE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CAP PARKS,
THE TEAM IS STAYING
OVER AT KAREN PARKS, MY TIMING IS UP.
SO, ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS,
I THINK THE DOLLARS CAN COME DOWN,
WORKED WELL WITHIN
YOUR PERCEIVED BUDGETS, AND WE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE SO FAR.
WE'LL COME BACK FOR ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
OR THOUGHTS, DISCUSSIONS.
DECISIONS TO MAKE, IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT
THAT WE ARE NOT IN A DESPERATE
SITUATION, WE'RE NOT IN A CASH FLOW CRUNCH.
WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH OUR MONEY,
GO BACK
TO THE TIER 3 LIST AGAIN.
I THINK THINGS THAT WE ARE
, THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO,
I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR US
TO DEFER FOR THE
SAKE OF DIFFERING WHEN IT'S GOING
TO COST US ADDITIONAL MONEY.
I APPRECIATE: BEING ON THIS LIST,
IT'S THE BIGGEST
ITEM ON THE LIST. I WOULD NOT BE
IN SUPPORT OF COMPLETELY DEFERRING THE
PROJECT MOVING IT OUT
OF ADDITIONAL YEARS BEYOND WHAT IS NECESSARY
. SIMPLY
CANNOT SPEND
AS MUCH GENERAL FUND MONEY NOW
WHEN IT WOULD MEAN WE WOULD
HAVE TO SPEND EVEN MORE GENERAL FUND
MONEY LATER BECAUSE WE KNOW WE
NEED TO DO IT. THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR THAT RENOVATION FOR
A LONG TIME, THE BATHROOM BUILDING
REALLY DOES NEED TO BE UPGRADED. WHAT
WOULD SUPPORT, AND THE COLD PART PIECE
WOULD BE TO LOOK AT,
ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE WANT
TO REDUCE THAT WE NEVER WANT TO DO? WITHIN THAT PROJECT
THE SCOPE AND SCALE FOR EXAMPLE.
THE LANDSCAPING
, THE LANDSCAPING PLAN WHAT WE INITIALLY
WANTED TO DO, DO WE REALLY NEED
TO REDO THIS PLAY STRUCTURE? IS IT
UNSAFE? IS IT SUFFICIENT?
THE EXERCISE COURSE,
I THINK, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR
FOR A LONG TIME, CAN WE LOOK AT WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THERE AND IS IN
THE RIGHT GAIL? BUT I WOULDN'T
SUPPORT PUTTING IT OFF JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF PUTTING IT OFF. THAT WILL COST US
MORE IN THE LONG RUN. THE STAGE STRUCTURE
I KNOW THAT WAS HEAD NODS FROM SOMETHING
THAT I BROUGHT, BUT
I'M NOT LOVING WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH
THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT, I WOULD BE
SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING THAT, AND HOPEFULLY
PUTTING
THAT INTO THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING.
EVERY TIME WE TOUCH A PARK,
LOOK AT ITS TRADE REQUIREMENTS, EVERY TIME
WE HAVE TO OPEN ANYTHING AT ANY
OF OUR PARKS, PARTICULARLY IN REGARDS
THE PLAYGROUNDS, EVALUATE IF SHADE
NEEDS AT
THE TIME, I THINK THERE'S ECONOMIES
TO BE
HAD BY DOING THAT AND I'M FINE WITH
US. DEFERRING OR EVEN ELIMINATING
THE CIP THAT JUST SAYS
SHADE STRUCTURES BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THIS WAS IMPLEMENTED,
NOT THE WAY I ENVISIONED IT THE WAY
THE REST
OF COUNCIL AND VISITED, THAT WOULD
BE MY RECOMMENDATION.
ON THE SPORTS PARK
BASEBALL FIELD UPGRADES, I'M SUPPORTIVE
OF MOVING THAT TO FUTURE PROJECTS, BUT I APPRECIATE
MR. HOUSTON'S COMMENTS,
APPRECIATE HIS COST ESTIMATES, I'M
LITTLE BIT LEERY OF THE COST ESTIMATES
FROM MEMBERS
OF THE PUBLIC, BECAUSE THEY ARE AND
WHAT OUR STAFF HAS BROUGHT TO US IS WHAT
IS GOING TO
COST, I CHUCKLED WHEN YOU SAID THEY
ARE SET IN STONE, MR. RUSSELL
WANTS THEM ALL SET LITERALLY IN STONE
AND BOLTED
TO THE CONCRETE AND THAT'S PARTIALLY
WHAT INCREASES OUR COSTS.
I DO THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHY THE WI-FI, WE WANT
TO, IF THAT'S PART OF THE 150,
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING?
AND THE GREEN MESH, ALL OF
THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE AND WE'RE GOING
TO SPEND THE ENTIRE 150.
IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET A CHEAP CONTAINER OUT THERE,
IF THAT IS A SMALL COST, IF THAT WHOLE
150 IS ALREADY GONE, THE CONTAINER
MAY BE SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON IF THERE'S
A WAY TO DO THAT.
THROUGH OUR AGREEMENT WITH EMERALD, OR
SOME OTHER
WAY WE'RE DOING THAT WITH LEPRECHAUNS IF THAT'S DOABLE.
AS FAR AS THE SEATING AND
ANYTHING ADDITIONAL BEYOND THAT, DEFERRING
THAT TO OUT YEARS MAKES
MORE SENSE TO ME. I'M
DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE SAN RAMON LANDSCAPING.
BUT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF
MOVING THAT OUTWARD SINCE THAT
NUMBER IS A COMPLETE GUESS IT WOULD
WAY MORE THAN THAT. I'M SUPPORTIVE
OF THE RECOMMENDATION ON THE STORM DRAINS,
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE IMPROVEMENTS, OTHERWISE
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO LIMIT OUR RENTALS, AND I'M NOT
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT
AND WE WANT TO PROTECT THAT ASSET. THAT'S
WHERE I LAND ON ALL OF THOSE.
THANK YOU. YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?
I USUALLY DO, YEAH, THANK YOU.
SO, SHADE STRUCTURES, I WAS A LITTLE BIT
SURPRISED. THIS
WAS PROBABLY BROUGHT UP.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS ALL PLANNING
AND THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL COST.
I AM IN FAVOR OF
DOING SOMETHING, FOR THAT, I
THINK IF WE COULD LOOK AT THAT FROM
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, AND I'M NOT
JUST TOPPING ABOUT UMBRELLAS,
THERE SHOULD BE A PROCESS, I DON'T
WANT TO GIVE UP
ON THAT. I THINK IT'S NECESSARY, I
JUST DON'T
THINK WE SHOULD BE SPENDING 200 GRAND FOR PLANNING.
FOR THIS TYPE OF THING. I AM SUPPORTIVE OF DOING SOMETHING.
BUT, NOT SPENDING
200 GRAND FOR PLANNING.
THAT, I'D LIKE TO GET SOME IDEA OF
THE COST WOULD BE, SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT CAN BE DONE QUICKER,
WITHIN OUR FISCAL PERIOD, THAT'S FINE.
IF IT NEEDS
TO BE PUSHED OUT, OKAY, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE UP ON IT.
I JUST THINK, FOR SOME REASON, THE PLANNING
IS REALLY, REALLY HIGH.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING TO GET
FEEDBACK ON THAT, I ALLUDED TO
THE FALLON SPORTS PARK CHANGES,
I WANTED IN MY
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I WANTED TO
GET A HANDLE ON WHERE THAT
500 GRAND CAME FROM, I DO
HAVE A BETTER IDEA, NOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE, REGARDLESS
I THINK WE CAN GET A
HANDLE ON THOSE CHANGES.
WE DON'T NEED 500 GRAND
TO MAKE A LOT OF THOSE CHANGES. I HAVE CLARIFICATION THAT
WE ARE SPENDING
THE 150 FOR THE
MESH, FOR THE FLAGPOLE,
AND FOR WHATEVER THE OTHER THING WAS,
SO IT'LL BE GONE. WELL UTILIZED.
DO THINK WE CAN PROBABLY INCLUDE SOME OF THIS AMOUNT
IN THE 25-26 BUDGET. I'M IN FAVOR OF
MAYBE IDENTIFYING WHAT
THE REAL NEED IS ON THAT.
IDENTIFYING WITHIN THE FISCAL PERIOD,
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO,
AND THEN IF THERE'S ANYTHING ,
PRIORITIZATION, PUSH IT OUT.
SAY WE NEED 250, 300, WHATEVER
THE NUMBER IS. AND YOU'RE TIMING THAT,
YOU IDENTIFY IN THE FISCAL
PERIOD, THE THINGS THAT YOU REALLY THINK
HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY. THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION.
I'M KIND
OF THINKING THAT WAY THROUGHOUT ALL
OF THIS, BECAUSE SOME OF THESE ITEMS ARE IMPORTANT,
AS WE'RE TWEAKING
THEM, MOVING THINGS AROUND.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN JUST SAY, LET'S JUST
SHOVE THEM OUT. WE
NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S CRITICAL, AND THIS
COLD PARK THING,
LINE ITEM IS
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT. I THINK
COUNCILMEMBER JOSEY BROUGHT THAT UP,
AND SHE
PROBABLY HAS A VERY GOOD KNOWLEDGE
OF THAT. A LITTLE BETTER DETAIL KNOWLEDGE BUT
THEY'RE PROBABLY ITEMS IN THERE THAT
ARE NECESSITIES,
AND SOME THAT ARE, WELL, WE MIGHT
AS WELL TRY TO
DO THIS, TOO. AND I THINK
COUNCILMEMBER JOSEY WAS CLEAR
AND SAID IS THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED?
OR IS IT PRETTY SAFE, NOW? I THINK THERE IS
ROOM TO DEFER
25-26. THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M TALKING, WELL,
YEAH. PUSHING IT OUT.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
THE BARN,
YEAH, I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE
OF DOING WHATEVER IS NECESSARY.
260 GRAND , I WAS UNCLEAR,
GOING TO GO BACK IF YOU PARDON ME AND SAY CLARIFICATION.
WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE DOING FOR 260 GRAND?
THAT IS TO STRENGTHEN THE FLOOR.
SO IT'S FOUNDATIONAL? NO. FROM
UNDERSIDE OF THE
EXISTING
1X6 FLOORING.
SUBFLOOR. RIGHT NOW THERE ISN'T ONE.
THE HISTORIC FABRIC ,
SPANNING FROM NEW CHOICES. THAT'S WHY
YOU HAVE THIS BASICALLY SPONGY FLOOR.
IT'S TO GO UNDERNEATH AND RE-SUPPORT WHAT'S THERE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO COSTLY, BECAUSE
YOU'RE HAVING TO DO EVERYTHING
FROM THE UNDERNEATH, NOT FROM THE
TOP.
TO CHECK THIS ONE,
I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT
OF CONTINUING WITH THAT PLAN,
THE SAN RAMON LANDSCAPING
I THINK, THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT.
I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF ELIMINATING
THAT, AND THEN
THE STORM DRAIN, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
SUPPORT TO UNDERSTAND, TO ME,
WHEN A STORM DRAIN IS PUT ON THERE,
AND YOU'VE PUT IT ON AS A TIER 3, I GUESS
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED. WHEN YOU WANT TO
PUT A STORM DRAIN IN, TO ME,
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF. I WAS WONDERING
WHY YOU, PARDON
ME, CLARIFICATION, WHY YOU PUT THAT ON THIS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A QUICK BACKGROUND
ON THAT?
IS A CONDITION ASSESSMENT
AT A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME, WHETHER
IT'S 10 YEARS, 15 YEARS FROM WHEN
IT WAS INSTALLED. RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT
RECEIVING A LOT OF REPORTS
OF ISSUES. SO, THIS IS
PART OF PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE.
IN, INSPECTING THE LINE, SEEING WHAT'S THERE,
AND IF WE
NEED TO WE WOULD DO POINT REPAIRS.
OKAY, I APPRECIATE THAT. THEN THERE'S
ROOM TO EVALUATE ON THAT AS WELL.
SO, I THINK YOU'VE TARGETED TIER 3 PROJECTS VERY WELL,
YOU'VE SEGREGATED THE
TIER 2 PROJECTS APPROPRIATELY, WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF A COUPLE OF
ITEMS THERE OF CURIOSITY.
I THINK THE FOCUS SHOULD
BE ON THE TIER 3 IN TERMS OF DEFERRALS,
ELIMINATION,
WHERE I'M GOING ON
I GOT ENOUGH INFORMATION.
SOME GUIDANCE, YES.
THANK YOU FOR
SEPARATING THIS OUT, I THINK, THERE'S A LOT HERE.
I THOUGHT
COUNCILMEMBER JOSEY WAS HEADING IN THE DIRECTION
THAT I HAD IN MIND WHICH WAS QUESTIONING
THE MARQUEE SIGNS AT 850 K, AND THE MONUMENT SIGNS
AT NEARLY 500 K,
I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE
, I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE MAKE A
WHOLE LOT OF SENSE.
I DON'T THINK THE VALUE IS
COMPENSABLE WITH THE COST.
THAT BEING SAID,
I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS AROUND
THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AS ELIMINATING
THE SHADE FOR NOW.
I CONCUR WITH
COUNCILMEMBER McCORRISTON
ON THE KOLB
PARK RENOVATION, AND JUST DIVING IN
SLIGHTLY
DEEPER AND FIGURING OUT
THE SAME APPROACH THAT YOU'VE TAKEN
IN TERMS OF THE TIER
1, TIER 2, TIER 3, DIVING INTO THAT, BECAUSE
IT IS A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND THEN, WITH
THE FALLON SPORTS MARKET, I'M HAVING
FIELD OF DREAMS FIVES, IF YOU
BUILD IT THEY WILL COME. I'M WONDERING, OUTSIDE OF
THE LEPRECHAUNS, WHO BENEFITS
FROM WHAT ,
AND DIVING INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT.
IF EMERALD HIGH SCHOOL OR LITTLE LEAGUE
OR SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO
BENEFIT FROM A PARTICULAR PROJECT AS OPPOSED
ANOTHER, I'M MORE INCLINED TO SUPPORT THAT
TO ONE ORGANIZATION OR ENTITY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE ANY INSIGHTS.
SURE, THE LEPRECHAUNS
ARE JUST ONE USER,
WE HAVE SO MANY USERS OF
OUR FIELDS AND FACILITIES. MY VISION
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
TO HAVE FACILITIES THAT ATTRACT OUTSIDE REGIONAL TOURNAMENTS.
THOSE
ARE BOOMS FOR THE COMMUNITY, THEY
GET KIDS INVOLVED AND INTERESTED IN
SPORTS, AND WATCHING AND FOR DISSIPATING,
AND THEY GET PEOPLE EATING IN OUR
RESTAURANT AND THINGS
LIKE THAT. OUTSIDE GROUPS USING IT IS
ONE THING, AND CERTAINLY
HAVING A PREMIUM
FIELD MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.
AGAIN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL USER GROUPS, TOO,
THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH FIELD SPACE AS IT IS,
FOR INSIDE SPORTS AND OUTSIDE SPORTS. HE'S
A PECANS, LITTLE
LEAGUE'S, ALL THE OTHER CLUBS THAT
COMPETE WITH LITTLE LEAGUE'S, THERE'S
SMALLER ONES THAT ARE
LOOKING FOR FIELD SPACE AND
PREMIUM SPOTS TO PLAY. AND BE IMPORTANT,
BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS LITTLE LEAGUE
AND EMERALD HIGH SCHOOL,
LOTS OF USERS.
RIGHT.
OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER THAT
500 K
ENTAILS, THAT'S A
LIST OF VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS.
MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO LOOK AT WHAT
THOSE INDIVIDUAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE, THOSE
THAT ACTUALLY BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY,
I WOULD RANK HIGHER THAN THOSE THAT DON'T.
WHAT VALUE IS A
MARQUEE SIGN ACTUALLY BRINGING?
WHAT REVENUE IS THAT GENERATING VERSUS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE
ALL AMERICAN, APPLE PIE, BASEBALL,
IT HAS A SENSE
OF COMMUNITY, I THINK IT ADDS VALUE.
BOTH MONETARILY, HARD
DOLLARS AS WELL AS SOFT.
GET THE COMMUNITY OUTSIDE BRINGING IT TOGETHER.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE DETAIL AROUND
THAT, THAT 500 K PLACEHOLDER,
THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BRINGING
VALUE TO THE COMMUNITY. I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST
A SIGN COSTING 40 K, BUT MAYBE
JUST DIVING INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE
I WOULD BE MORE INCLINED AND CERTAINLY
GOING BACK TO THE BARN IMPROVEMENTS,
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY HISTORICAL SITE,
I WISH
STEVE WAS HERE TO EDUCATE ME ON THE
FULL HISTORY OF IT, GETTING TO
A POINT THAT WE'RE DESTROYING A HISTORICAL SITE,
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT AT THIS POINT.
I DON'T KNOW IF
THE COUNCIL AGREES IN TERMS OF,
POTENTIALLY THREATENING THE INTEGRITY
OF THAT FLOOR.
THIS RETROFITTING.
THE POINT
WAS MADE THAT IF WE DON'T REINFORCE
THE FLOOR, IT COULD RESPOND EUNICE
COULD CAUSE
COALS AND PERMANENT DAMAGE.
I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY
OF PEOPLE USING IT, LESS CONCERN ABOUT THE TRAMPOLINE EFFECT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE COUNCIL FEELS.
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENT.
THE RETROFITTING GUN. IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING, THEN.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS,
ACTUALLY AM EXCITED WHEN I HEARD YOUR COMMENT.
SO, WE HAVE A VISION. WE HAVE A VISION
MAKE DOUBLE AND BECOME A
SPORTS DESTINY, AND IN THE FUTURE,
WITH THE BASEBALL FIELD, EVENT CENTER,
AND ARE PASSIONATE YOUNG ATHLETES,
AND ALSO ADULT
ATHLETES, I ENVISION WE WILL BE ABLE
TO KEEP THRIVING.
RIGHT NOW OUR BUDGET
IS IN GREAT SHAPE, WE ARE NOT
AS MUCH
LAST YEAR, BUT WE ARE MUCH BETTER
THAN
ALL OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES, WE ARE IN
POSITIVE SURPLUS POSITION.
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH, OR
WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK
AT ALL THOSE WAYS TO TRY AND ELIMINATE
DEFER, THAT'S HOW I FEEL LIKE WE
KEEP THIS POSITIVE MOMENTUM. KEEP
GOING, KEEP DOING THINGS. WE'LL
THRIVE OUR BUSINESS, WE'LL GENERATE MORE REVENUES,
AND WE WILL BE ABLE
TO COVER, OF COURSE,
WE'LL COVER OUR BUDGET, OUR EXPENDITURE,
AND WE'LL DO BETTER.
THAT'S WHAT I FEEL. I FEEL ALL THOSE
ITEMS, IT'S GREAT YOU GO INTO ALL THE
DETAILS, WE LOOK AT ALL THE
THINGS, AND I AGREE WITH ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT
[ INAUDIBLE ] LOOK AT
THE SPORTS PARK WE WANT TO SUPPORT,
WE WANT TO MAKE THIS, ATTRACT
THE PLAYERS, ATHLETES HERE.
WE WANT TO DO IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO
DO. SO, I DON'T FEEL
GREAT ABOUT MARQUEE SIGNS, EITHER.
HOW ABOUT --
I AGREE.
MY POSITION ON THE MARQUEE SIGNS IS ALL OR NOTHING.
THE REASON THAT WE'VE HAD SO MANY DISCUSSIONS
THE MARQUEE SIGNS IS BECAUSE THERE
WAS SUCH A IMBALANCE
BETWEEN EAST AND WEST.
WHICH IS WHY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT
MULTIPLE TIMES, BECAUSE WE WERE GOING
TO REHAB TO MARQUEE SIGNS IN WEST DUBLIN,
AND ADD ANOTHER MARQUEE SIGN
VERY CLOSE TO THE ONES WE'RE REHABBING IN
WEST DUBLIN, AND THERE WERE NO MARQUEE
SIGNS IN EAST DUBLIN, AND
MY POSITION WAS THAT
IF WE FELT LIKE
MARQUEE SIGNS WERE IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT
ENOUGH TO BE REHABBING TWO EXISTING
ONES AND ADDING A THIRD,
THEN WE OUGHT TO HAVE
ONE WHERE THE BALANCE OF THE POPULATION
IS IN EAST DUBLIN, THAT'S HOW WE ENDED
UP WITH FOUR MARQUEE SIGNS.
BUT, I AGREE, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY
FOR MARQUEE SIGNS, AND,
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED ANY MARQUEE
SIGNS, WHICH IS WHY
I ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
IF THEY GO DARK? BUT I ALSO DON'T
LIKE THE IMAGE OF
UGLY MARQUEE SIGNS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE FEEL
WE NEED ONE AT CITY HALL.
I DON'T WANT US TO GO INTO MARQUEE SIGNS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BUT,
I DON'T LOVE THE IDEA OF AN
EMPTY OR DARK ONE AND THE SENIOR CENTER,
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WANT TO ADD ANOTHER ONE HERE
WHEN EVERYBODY'S DRIVING BY, AND IF
WE ARE ADDING ONE HERE, THEN WE ARE
SAYING WE THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT
ENOUGH TO ADD ANOTHER ONE,
WE DON'T WILL BETTER
BE ADDING ONE ON THE EAST SIDE OF
TIME AS WELL.
IT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY LIKES THE
MARQUEE SIGNS THAT MUCH.
MAYBE LOOK AT WAYS TO REMOVE
THE MARQUEE SIGNS OR SEE HOW BAD TO
GO DARK IT IS. AND ADDING NEW ONES.
THAT'S NOT
NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY, WE SHOULD
EVALUATE WHAT WE NEED. I APPRECIATE
WE'RE GOING BACK NOW, TWO YEARS
LATER AND RE-EVALUATING THIS.
I AM,
FOR STUDYING THIS, TO SEE IF THERE'S
A WAY, AND THAT'S IT.
IT'S NOT ALL OR NOTHING FOR ME, IT'S,
LET'S SEE WHAT MAKES SENSE. AND LET'S INVEST QUALITY TIME
IN MAKING A
DECISION A PERMANENT DECISION, AND
THAT'S ALL I'M HERE
FOR IS GETTING KIND OF LATE, BUT, I'M
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GOING IN AND ANALYZING IT.
BUT IT'S
NOT JUST CUT THEM ALL OR LEAVE THEM
ALL IN FOR ME, IS WHATEVER
MAKES SENSE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
TIER
3, LET IT RIDE INTO THE SUNSET.
I'M SORRY, I NEED CLARITY, AS THEY FAIL,
WE'RE REMOVING THEM.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THE COST OF REMOVING THEM,
IT'S EITHER REMOVE OR REPAIR. AND SOMETIMES
REMOVAL IS MORE EXTENSIVE THAN REPAIRING
BECAUSE THEY'RE ENCASED IN CONCRETE
IT'S THE ONE AT SHANNON,
IT WOULD BE EXPENSIVE
TO REMOVE IT. SO LET'S
, CAN I ASK A QUICK QUESTION? I'M NOT
SURE, I THINK WE WERE
ALL IN AGREEMENT IN EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR COLE,
BUT I HEARD
MULTIPLE THINGS ABOUT AS FAR AS DEFERRING IT
OR NOT DEFERRING IT, WE ALL ASKED
FOR MORE CLARITY ON THE DIFFERENT
ITEMS THAT ARE PART OF THAT. BUT
I THINK MIKE SAID DEFER IT,
I SAID LOOK
--WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND WHAT IS
, WE PUT THIS IN HERE BECAUSE IT WAS
A REALLY GOOD THING.
